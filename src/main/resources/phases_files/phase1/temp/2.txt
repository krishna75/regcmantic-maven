5.1 Production should be performed and supervised by competent people.
5.2 All handling of materials and products, such as receipt and quarantine, sampling, storage,
labelling, dispensing, processing, packaging and distribution should be done in accordance
with written procedures or instructions and, where necessary, recorded.
5.3 All incoming materials should be checked to ensure that the consignment corresponds to
the order. Containers should be cleaned where necessary and labelled with the prescribed
data.
5.4 Damage to containers and any other problem which might adversely affect the quality of a
material should be investigated, recorded and reported to the Quality Control Department.
5.5 Incoming materials and finished products should be physically or administratively
quarantined immediately after receipt or processing, until they have been released for use
or distribution.
5.6 Intermediate and bulk products purchased as such should be handled on receipt as though
they were starting materials.
5.7 All materials and products should be stored under the appropriate conditions established
by the manufacturer and in an orderly fashion to permit batch segregation and stock
rotation.
5.8 Checks on yields, and reconciliation of quantities, should be carried out as necessary to
ensure that there are no discrepancies outside acceptable limits.
5.9 Operations on different products should not be carried out simultaneously or consecutively
in the same room unless there is no risk of mix-up or cross-contamination.
5.10 At every stage of processing, products and materials should be protected from microbial and
other contamination.
5.11 When working with dry materials and products, special precautions should be taken to
prevent the generation and dissemination of dust. This applies particularly to the handling
of highly active or sensitising materials.
5.12 At all times during processing, all materials, bulk containers, major items of equipment
and where appropriate rooms used should be labelled or otherwise identified with an
indication of the product or material being processed, its strength (where applicable) and
batch number. Where applicable, this indication should also mention the stage of
production.
5.13 Labels applied to containers, equipment or premises should be clear, unambiguous and in
the companyï¿½s agreed format. It is often helpful in addition to the wording on the labels to
use colours to indicate status (for example, quarantined, accepted, rejected, clean, ...).
5.14 Checks should be carried out to ensure that pipelines and other pieces of equipment used
for the transportation of products from one area to another are connected in a correct
manner.
5.15 Any deviation from instructions or procedures should be avoided as far as possible. If a
deviation occurs, it should be approved in writing by a competent person, with the
involvement of the Quality Control Department when appropriate.
5.16 Access to production premises should be restricted to authorised personnel.
5.17 Normally, the production of non-medicinal products should be avoided in areas and with
the equipment destined for the production of medicinal products.
