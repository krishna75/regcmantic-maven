5.18 Contamination of a starting material or of a product by another material or product must
be avoided. This risk of accidental cross-contamination arises from the uncontrolled release
of dust, gases, vapours, sprays or organisms from materials and products in process, from
residues on equipment, and from operators� clothing. The significance of this risk varies
with the type of contaminant and of product being contaminated. Amongst the most
hazardous contaminants are highly sensitising materials, biological preparations
containing living organisms, certain hormones, cytotoxics, and other highly active
materials. Products in which contamination is likely to be most significant are those
administered by injection, those given in large doses and/or over a long time.
5.19 Cross-contamination should be avoided by appropriate technical or organisational
measures, for example:
a) production in segregated areas (required for products such as penicillins, live
vaccines, live bacterial preparations and some other biologicals), or by campaign
(separation in time) followed by appropriate cleaning;
b) providing appropriate air-locks and air extraction;
c) minimising the risk of contamination caused by recirculation or re-entry of untreated
or insufficiently treated air;
d) keeping protective clothing inside areas where products with special risk of cross-
contamination are processed;
e) using cleaning and decontamination procedures of known effectiveness, as ineffective
cleaning of equipment is a common source of cross-contamination;
f) using �closed systems&quot; of production;
g) testing for residues and use of cleaning status labels on equipment.
5.20 Measures to prevent cross-contamination and their effectiveness should be checked
periodically according to set procedures.
