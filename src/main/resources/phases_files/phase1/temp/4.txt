5.21 Validation studies should reinforce Good Manufacturing Practice and be conducted in
accordance with defined procedures. Results and conclusions should be recorded.
5.22 When any new manufacturing formula or method of preparation is adopted, steps should be
taken to demonstrate its suitability for routine processing. The defined process, using the
materials and equipment specified, should be shown to yield a product consistently of the
required quality.
5.23 Significant amendments to the manufacturing process, including any change in equipment
or materials, which may affect product quality and/or the reproducibility of the process
should be validated.
5.24 Processes and procedures  should undergo periodic critical  re-validation to ensure that they
remain capable of achieving the intended results.
