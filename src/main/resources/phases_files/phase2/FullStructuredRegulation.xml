<regulation id="19.10"> <sentence count=""> 19.10  Not all the controls in the previous sections of this Guide are appropriate for 
the manufacture of a new API for investigational use during its development. </sentence>
 <sentence count=""> Section 
19 provides specific guidance unique to these circumstances. </sentence>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation id="19.11"> <sentence count=""> 19.11  The controls used in the manufacture of APIs for use in clinical trials should 
be consistent with the stage of development of the drug product incorporating the 
API. </sentence>
 <sentence count=""> Process and test procedures should be flexible to provide for changes as 
knowledge of the process increases and clinical testing of a drug product progresses 
from pre-clinical stages through clinical stages. </sentence>
 <sentence count=""> Once drug development reaches the 
stage where the API is produced for use in drug products intended for clinical trials, 
manufacturers should ensure that APIs are manufactured in suitable facilities using 
appropriate production and control procedures to ensure the quality of the API. </sentence>

 </subsection>
<subsection id="19.2"> <title>19.2  Quality </title>
 
<regulation id=""> <sentence count=""> 19.20  Appropriate GMP concepts should be applied in the production of APIs for 
use in clinical trials with a suitable mechanism of approval of each batch. </sentence>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation id="19.21"> <sentence count=""> 19.21  A quality unit(s) independent from production should be established for the 
approval or rejection of each batch of API for use in clinical trials. </sentence>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation id="19.22"> <sentence count=""> 19.22  Some of the testing functions commonly performed by the quality unit(s) can 
be performed within other organizational units. </sentence>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation id="19.23"> <sentence count=""> 19.23  Quality measures should include a system for testing of raw materials, 
packaging materials, intermediates, and APIs. </sentence>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation id="19.24"> <sentence count=""> 19.24  Process and quality problems should be evaluated. </sentence>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation id="19.25"> <sentence count=""> 19.25  Labelling for APIs intended for use in clinical trials should be appropriately 
controlled and should identify the material as being for investigational use. </sentence>
 
 
 
 </regulation>
 </subsection>
<subsection id="19.3"> <title> 19.3  Equipment and Facilities </title>
 
 
<regulation id="19.30"> <sentence count=""> 19.30  During all phases of clinical development, including the use of small-scale 
facilities or laboratories to manufacture batches of APIs for use in clinical trials, 
procedures should be in place to ensure that equipment is calibrated, clean and 
suitable for its intended use. </sentence>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation id="19.31"> <sentence count=""> 19.31  Procedures for the use of facilities should ensure that materials are handled in 
a manner that minimizes the risk of contamination and cross-contamination. </sentence>

 </subsection>
<subsection id="19.4"> <title> 19.4  Control of Raw Materials </title>
 
 
<regulation id="19.40"> <sentence count=""> 19.40  Raw materials used in production of APIs for use in clinical trials should be 
evaluated by testing, or received with a supplierâ€™s analysis and subjected to identity 
testing. </sentence>
 <sentence count=""> When a material is considered hazardous, a supplier's analysis should suffice. </sentence>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation id="19.41"> <sentence count=""> 19.41  In some instances, the suitability of a raw material can be determined before 
use based on acceptability in small-scale reactions (i.e., use testing) rather than on 
analytical testing alone. </sentence>
 
 
 
 </regulation>
 </subsection>
<subsection id="19.5"> <title> 19.5  Production </title>
 
 
<regulation id="19.50"> <sentence count=""> 19.50  The production of APIs for use in clinical trials should be documented in 
laboratory notebooks, batch records, or by other appropriate means. </sentence>
 <sentence count=""> These documents 
should include information on the use of production materials, equipment, processing, 
and scientific observations. </sentence>

 </regulation>
<regulation id="19.51"> 19.51  Expected yields can be more variable and less defined than the expected yields 
used in commercial processes. <sentence count=""> Investigations into yield variations are not expected. </sentence>

<subsection id="19.6"> <title> 19.6  Validation </title>
 
 
<regulation id="19.60"> <sentence count=""> 19.60  Process validation for the production of APIs for use in clinical trials is 
normally inappropriate, where a single API batch is produced or where process 
changes during API development make batch replication difficult or inexact. </sentence>
 <sentence count=""> The 
combination of controls, calibration, and, where appropriate, equipment qualification 
assures API quality during this development phase. </sentence>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation id="19.61"> <sentence count=""> 19.61  Process validation should be conducted in accordance with Section 12 when 
batches are produced for commercial use, even when such batches are produced on a 
pilot or small scale. </sentence>

 </subsection>
<subsection id="19.7"> <title> 19.7  Changes </title>
 
 
<regulation id="19.70"> <sentence count=""> 19.70  Changes are expected during development, as knowledge is gained and the 
production is scaled up. </sentence>
 <sentence count=""> Every change in the production, specifications, or test 
procedures should be adequately recorded. </sentence>

<subsection id="19.8"> <title> 19.8  Laboratory Controls </title>
 
 
<regulation id="19.80"> <sentence count=""> 19.80  While analytical methods performed to evaluate a batch of API for clinical 
trials may not yet be validated, they should be scientifically sound. </sentence>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation id="19.81"> <sentence count=""> 19.81  A system for retaining reserve samples of all batches should be in place. </sentence>
 <sentence count=""> This 
system should ensure that a sufficient quantity of each reserve sample is retained for 
an appropriate length of time after approval, termination, or discontinuation of an 
application. </sentence>

<regulation id="19.90"> <sentence count=""> 19.90  A system should be in place to ensure that information gained during the 
development and the manufacture of APIs for use in clinical trials is documented and 
available. </sentence>
