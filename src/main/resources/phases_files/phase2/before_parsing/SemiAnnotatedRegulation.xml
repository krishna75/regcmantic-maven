1 Introduction 
This guideline was published in November 2000 as Annex 18 to the GMP Guide 
reflecting the EU’s agreement to ICH Q7A and has been used by manufacturers and 
GMP inspectorates on a voluntary basis.  Article 46 (f) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
Article 50 (f) of Directive 2001/82/EC; as amended by Directives 2004/27/EC and 
2004/28/EC respectively, place new obligations on manufacturing authorisation 
holders to use only active substances that have been manufactured in accordance with 
Good Manufacturing Practice for starting materials.  The directives go on to say that 
the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice for active substances are to be adopted 
as detailed guidelines.  Member States have agreed that the text of former Annex 18 
should form the basis of the detailed guidelines to create Part II of the GMP Guide. 
 
1.1 Objective 
These guidelines are intended to provide guidance regarding Good Manufacturing 
Practice (GMP) for the manufacture of active substances under an appropriate system 
for managing quality. It is also intended to help ensure that active substances meet the 
requirements for quality and purity that they purport or are represented to possess. 
 
In these guidelines “manufacturing” includes all operations of receipt of materials, 
production, packaging, repackaging, labeling, relabelling, quality control, release, 
storage and distribution of active substances and the related controls. The term 
“should” indicates recommendations that are expected to apply unless shown to be 
inapplicable, modified in any relevant annexes to the GMP Guide, or replaced by an 
alternative demonstrated to provide at least an equivalent level of quality assurance. 
 
The GMP Guide as a whole does not cover safety aspects for the personnel engaged 
in manufacture, nor aspects of protection of the environment. These controls are 
inherent responsibilities of the manufacturer and are governed by other parts of the 
legislation. 
 
These guidelines are not intended to define registration requirements or modify 
pharmacopoeial requirements and do not affect the ability of the responsible 
competent authority to establish specific registration requirements regarding active 
substances within the context of marketing/manufacturing authorisations.  All 
commitments in registration documents must be met. 
 
1.2 Scope 
These guidelines apply to the manufacture of active substances for medicinal products 
for both human and veterinary use.  They apply to the manufacture of sterile active 
substances only up to the point immediately prior to the active substance being 
rendered sterile. The sterilisation and aseptic processing of sterile active substances 
are not covered, but should be performed in accordance with the principles and 
guidelines of GMP as laid down in Directive 2003/94/EC and interpreted in the GMP 
Guide including its Annex 1. 
In the case of ectoparasiticides for veterinary use, other standards than these 
guidelines, that ensure that the material is of appropriate quality, may be used. 
 
These guidelines exclude, whole blood and plasma, as Directive 2002/98/EC and the 
technical requirements supporting that directive lay down the detailed requirements 
for the collection and testing of blood, however, it does include active substances that 
 6
are produced using blood or plasma as raw materials.  Finally, these guidelines do not 
apply to bulk-packaged medicinal products.  They apply to all other active starting 
materials subject to any derogations described in the annexes to the GMP Guide, in 
particular Annexes 2 to 7 where supplementary guidance for certain types of active 
substance may be found.  The annexes will consequently undergo a review but in the 
meantime and only until this review is complete, manufacturers may choose to 
continue to use Part I of the basic requirements and the relevant annexes for products 
covered by those annexes, or may already apply Part II.  
 
Section 19 contains guidance that only applies to the manufacture of active substances 
used in the production of investigational medicinal products although it should be 
noted that its application in this case, although recommended, is not required by 
Community legislation.  
 
An “Active Substance Starting Material” is a raw material, intermediate, or an active 
substance that is used in the production of an active substance and that is incorporated 
as a significant structural fragment into the structure of the active substance. An 
Active Substance Starting Material can be an article of commerce, a material 
purchased from one or more suppliers under contract or commercial agreement, or 
produced in-house. Active Substance Starting Materials normally have defined 
chemical properties and structure. 
 
The manufacturer should designate and document the rationale for the point at which 
production of the active substance begins. For synthetic processes, this is known as 
the point at which "Active Substance Starting Materials" are entered into the process. 
For other processes (e.g. fermentation, extraction, purification, etc), this rationale 
should be established on a case-by-case basis. Table 1 gives guidance on the point at 
which the Active Substance Starting Material is normally introduced into the process.  
From this point on, appropriate GMP as defined in these guidelines should be applied 
to these intermediate and/or active substance manufacturing steps. This would include 
the validation of critical process steps determined to impact the quality of the active 
substance. However, it should be noted that the fact that a manufacturer chooses to 
validate a process step does not necessarily define that step as critical.  The guidance 
in this document would normally be applied to the steps shown in grey in Table 1.  It 
does not imply that all steps shown should be completed. The stringency of GMP in 
active substance manufacturing should increase as the process proceeds from early 
steps to final steps, purification, and packaging. Physical processing of active 
substances, such as granulation, coating or physical manipulation of particle size (e.g. 
milling, micronising), should be conducted at least to the standards of these 
guidelines.  These guidelines do not apply to steps prior to the first introduction of the 
defined "Active Substance Starting Material". 
 
In the remainder of this guideline the term Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) is 
used repeatedly and should be considered interchangeable with the term “Active 
Substance”.  The glossary in section 20 of Part II should only be applied in the 
context of Part II. Some of the same terms are already defined in Part I of the GMP 
guide and these therefore should only be applied in the context of Part I.

<regulation> <statement> 4.22  If air is recirculated to production areas, appropriate measures should be taken 
to control risks of contamination and cross-contamination. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 4.23  Permanently installed pipework should be appropriately identified. </statement>
 <statement> This can be 
accomplished by identifying individual lines, documentation, computer control 
systems, or alternative means. </statement>
 <statement> Pipework should be located to avoid risks of 
contamination of the intermediate or API. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 4.24  Drains should be of adequate size and should be provided with an air break or 
a suitable device to prevent back-siphonage, when appropriate. </statement>
 
 
 
 </regulation>
 </subsection>
<subsection> <subsection_title> 4.3  Water </subsection_title>
 
 
<regulation> <statement> 4.30  Water used in the manufacture of APIs should be demonstrated to be suitable 
for its intended use. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 4.31  Unless otherwise justified, process water should, at a minimum, meet World 
Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for drinking (potable) water quality. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 4.32  If drinking (potable) water is insufficient to assure API quality, and tighter 
chemical and/or microbiological water quality specifications are called for, 
appropriate specifications for physical/chemical attributes, total microbial counts, 
objectionable organisms and/or endotoxins should be established. </statement>
 
 
 14
 </regulation>
<regulation> 4.33  Where water used in the process is treated by the manufacturer to achieve a 
defined quality, the treatment process should be validated and monitored with 
appropriate action limits. 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 4.34  Where the manufacturer of a non-sterile API either intends or claims that it is 
suitable for use in further processing to produce a sterile drug (medicinal) product, 
water used in the final isolation and purification steps should be monitored and 
controlled for total microbial counts, objectionable organisms, and endotoxins. </statement>
 
 
 
 </regulation>
 </subsection>
<subsection> <subsection_title> 4.4  Containment </subsection_title>
 
 
<regulation> <statement> 4.40  Dedicated production areas, which can include facilities, air handling 
equipment and/or process equipment, should be employed in the production of highly 
sensitizing materials, such as penicillins or cephalosporins. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 4.41  Dedicated production areas should also be considered when material of an 
infectious nature or high pharmacological activity or toxicity is involved (e.g., certain 
steroids or cytotoxic anti-cancer agents) unless validated inactivation and/or cleaning 
procedures are established and maintained. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 4.42  Appropriate measures should be established and implemented to prevent 
cross-contamination from personnel, materials, etc. moving from one dedicated area

intermediate or API. </statement>
 <statement> In-process mixing of fractions from single batches (e.g., 
collecting several centrifuge loads from a single crystallization batch) or combining 
fractions from several batches for further processing is considered to be part of the 
production process and is not considered to be blending. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 8.41  Out-Of-Specification batches should not be blended with other batches for the 
purpose of meeting specifications. </statement>
 <statement> Each batch incorporated into the blend should have 
been manufactured using an established process and should have been individually 
tested and found to meet appropriate specifications prior to blending. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>

- Blending of small batches to increase batch size 
- Blending of tailings (i.e., relatively small quantities of isolated material) from 
batches of the same intermediate orAPItoforma single batch. </statement>

<regulation> <statement> 8.43  Blending processes should be adequately controlled and documented and the 
blended batch should be tested for conformance to established specifications where 
appropriate. </statement>

<regulation> <statement> 8.45  Where physical attributes of the API are critical (e.g., APIs intended for use in 
solid oral dosage forms or suspensions), blending operations should be validated to 
show homogeneity of the combined batch. </statement>
 <statement> Validation should include testing of critical 
attributes (e.g., particle size distribution, bulk density, and tap density) that may be 
affected by the blending process. </statement>

the wall of a micronizer, residual layer of damp crystals remaining in a centrifuge 
 28
bowl after discharge, and incomplete discharge of fluids or crystals from a processing 
vessel upon transfer of the material to the next step in the process. </statement>

container. </statement>
 <statement> For example, if the API is marketed in bags within fiber drums, stability 
samples can be packaged in bags of the same material and in smaller-scale drums of 
similar or identical material composition to the market drums. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 11.53  Normally the first three commercial production batches should be placed on 
the stability monitoring program to confirm the retest or expiry date. </statement>

data from previous studies show that the API is expected to remain stable for at least 
two years, fewer than three batches can be used. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 11.54  Thereafter, at least one batch per year of API manufactured (unless none is 
produced that year) should be added to the stability monitoring program and tested at 
least annually to confirm the stability. </statement>

 <statement> For 
example, for those biotechnological/biologic and other APIs with shelf-lives of one 
year or less, stability samples should be obtained and should be tested monthly for the 
first three months, and at three month intervals after that. </statement>

confirm that the stability of the API is not compromised, elimination of specific test 
intervals (e.g. 9 month testing) can be considered. </statement>

<subsection> <subsection_title> 12.1  Validation Policy </subsection_title>
 
 
<regulation> <statement> 12.10  The company's overall policy, intentions, and approach to validation, 
including the validation of production processes, cleaning procedures, analytical 
methods, in-process control test procedures, computerized systems, and persons 
responsible for design, review, approval and documentation of each validation phase, 
should be documented. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.11  The critical parameters/attributes should normally be identified during the 
development stage or from historical data, and the ranges necessary for the 
reproducible operation should be defined. </statement>
 <statement> This should include: </statement>
 
 
<statement> - Defining the API in terms of its critical product attributes; 
- Identifying process parameters that could affect the critical quality attributes 
of the API; 
 35
- Determining the range for each critical process parameter expected to be used 
during routine manufacturing and process control. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.12  Validation should extend to those operations determined to be critical to the 
quality and purity of the API. </statement>
 
 
 
 </regulation>
 </subsection>
<subsection> <subsection_title> 12.2  Validation Documentation </subsection_title>
 
 
<regulation> <statement> 12.20  A written validation protocol should be established that specifies how 
validation of a particular process will be conducted. </statement>
 <statement> The protocol should be reviewed 
and approved by the quality unit(s) and other designated units. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.21  The validation protocol should specify critical process steps and acceptance 
criteria as well as the type of validation to be conducted (e.g. retrospective, 
prospective, concurrent) and the number of process runs. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.22  A validation report that cross-references the validation protocol should be 
prepared, summarising the results obtained, commenting on any deviations observed, 
and drawing the appropriate conclusions, including recommending changes to correct 
deficiencies. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.23  Any variations from the validation protocol should be documented with 
appropriate justification. </statement>

 </subsection>
<subsection> <subsection_title> 12.3  Qualification </subsection_title>
 
 
<regulation> <statement> 12.30  Before starting process validation activities, appropriate qualification of 
critical equipment and ancillary systems should be completed. </statement>
 <statement> Qualification is usually 
carried out by conducting the following activities, individually or combined: </statement>
 
 
<statement> - Design Qualification (DQ): documented verification that the proposed design 
of the facilities, equipment, or systems is suitable for the intended purpose. </statement>
 
<statement> - Installation Qualification (IQ): documented verification that the equipment or 
systems, as installed or modified, comply with the approved design, the 
manufacturer’s recommendations and/or user requirements. </statement>
 
<statement> - Operational Qualification (OQ): documented verification that the equipment 
or systems, as installed or modified, perform as intended throughout the 
anticipated operating ranges. </statement>
 
<statement> - Performance Qualification (PQ): documented verification that the equipment 
and ancillary systems, as connected together, can perform effectively and 
reproducibly based on the approved process method and specifications. </statement>
 
 
 36
 </regulation>
 </subsection>
<subsection> 12.4  Approaches to Process Validation 
 
<regulation> <statement> 12.40  Process Validation (PV) is the documented evidence that the process, operated 
within established parameters, can perform effectively and reproducibly to produce an 
intermediate or API meeting its predetermined specifications and quality attributes. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.41  There are three approaches to validation. </statement>
 <statement> Prospective validation is the 
preferred approach, but there are exceptions where the other approaches can be used. </statement>
 
<statement> These approaches and their applicability are listed below. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.42  Prospective validation should normally be performed for all API processes as 
defined in 12.12. </statement>
 <statement> Prospective validation performed on an API process should be 
completed before the commercial distribution of the final drug product manufactured 
from that API. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.43  Concurrent validation can be conducted when data from replicate production 
runs are unavailable because only a limited number of API batches have been 
produced, API batches are produced infrequently, or API batches are produced by a 
validated process that has been modified. </statement>
 <statement> Prior to the completion of concurrent 
validation, batches can be released and used in final drug product for commercial 
distribution based on thorough monitoring and testing of the API batches. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.44  An exception can be made for retrospective validation for well established 
processes that have been used without significant changes to API quality due to 
changes in raw materials, equipment, systems, facilities, or the production process. </statement>
 <statement> 
This validation approach may be used where: </statement>
 
 
<statement> (1) Critical quality attributes and critical process parameters have been identified; 
(2) Appropriate in-process acceptance criteria and controls have been established; 
(3) There have not been significant process/product failures attributable to causes 
other than operator error or equipment failures unrelated to equipment suitability; and 
(4) Impurity profiles have been established for the existing API. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.45  Batches selected for retrospective validation should be representative of all 
batches made during the review period, including any batches that failed to meet 
specifications, and should be sufficient in number to demonstrate process consistency. </statement>
 
<statement> Retained samples can be tested to obtain data to retrospectively validate the process. </statement>
 
 
 
 </regulation>
 </subsection>
<subsection> <subsection_title> 12.5  Process Validation Program </subsection_title>
 
 
<regulation> <statement> 12.50  The number of process runs for validation should depend on the complexity of 
the process or the magnitude of the process change being considered. </statement>
 <statement> For prospective 
and concurrent validation, three consecutive successful production batches should be 
used as a guide, but there may be situations where additional process runs are 
warranted to prove consistency of the process (e.g., complex API processes or API 
processes with prolonged completion times). </statement>
 <statement> For retrospective validation, generally 
 37
data from ten to thirty consecutive batches should be examined to assess process 
consistency, but fewer batches can be examined if justified. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.51  Critical process parameters should be controlled and monitored during process 
validation studies. </statement>
 <statement> Process parameters unrelated to quality, such as variables 
controlled to minimize energy consumption or equipment use, need not be included in 
the process validation. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.52  Process validation should confirm that the impurity profile for each API is 
within the limits specified. </statement>
 <statement> The impurity profile should be comparable to or better 
than historical data and, where applicable, the profile determined during process 
development or for batches used for pivotal clinical and toxicological studies. </statement>
 
 
 
 </regulation>
 </subsection>
<subsection> <subsection_title> 12.6  Periodic Review of Validated Systems </subsection_title>
 
 
<regulation> <statement> 12.60  Systems and processes should be periodically evaluated to verify that they are 
still operating in a valid manner. </statement>
 <statement> Where no significant changes have been made to the 
system or process, and a quality review confirms that the system or process is 
consistently producing material meeting its specifications, there is normally no need 
for revalidation. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
 </subsection>
<subsection> <subsection_title> 12.7  Cleaning Validation </subsection_title>
 
 
<regulation> <statement> 12.70  Cleaning procedures should normally be validated. </statement>
 <statement> In general, cleaning 
validation should be directed to situations or process steps where contamination or 
carryover of materials poses the greatest risk to API quality. </statement>
 <statement> For example, in early 
production it may be unnecessary to validate equipment cleaning procedures where 
residues are removed by subsequent purification steps. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.71  Validation of cleaning procedures should reflect actual equipment usage 
patterns. </statement>
 <statement> If various APIs or intermediates are manufactured in the same equipment 
and the equipment is cleaned by the same process, a representative intermediate or 
API can be selected for cleaning validation. </statement>
 <statement> This selection should be based on the 
solubility and difficulty of cleaning and the calculation of residue limits based on 
potency, toxicity, and stability. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.72  The cleaning validation protocol should describe the equipment to be cleaned, 
procedures, materials, acceptable cleaning levels, parameters to be monitored and 
controlled, and analytical methods. </statement>
 <statement> The protocol should also indicate the type of 
samples to be obtained and how they are collected and labelled. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.73  Sampling should include swabbing, rinsing, or alternative methods (e.g., direct 
extraction), as appropriate, to detect both insoluble and soluble residues. </statement>
 <statement> The 
sampling methods used should be capable of quantitatively measuring levels of 
residues remaining on the equipment surfaces after cleaning. </statement>
 <statement> Swab sampling may be 
impractical when product contact surfaces are not easily accessible due to equipment 
design and/or process limitations (e.g., inner surfaces of hoses, transfer pipes, reactor 
tanks with small ports or handling toxic materials, and small intricate equipment such 
as micronizers and microfluidizers). </statement>
 <statement> 
 38 </statement>

 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.74  Validated analytical methods having sensitivity to detect residues or 
contaminants should be used. </statement>
 <statement> The detection limit for each analytical method should 
be sufficiently sensitive to detect the established acceptable level of the residue or 
contaminant. </statement>
 <statement> The method’s attainable recovery level should be established. </statement>
 <statement> Residue 
limits should be practical, achievable, verifiable and based on the most deleterious 
residue. </statement>
 <statement> Limits can be established based on the minimum known pharmacological, 
toxicological, or physiological activity of the API or its most deleterious component. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.75  Equipment cleaning/sanitization studies should address microbiological and 
endotoxin contamination for those processes where there is a need to reduce total 
microbiological count or endotoxins in the API, or other processes where such 
contamination could be of concern (e.g., non-sterile APIs used to manufacture sterile 
products). </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.76  Cleaning procedures should be monitored at appropriate intervals after 
validation to ensure that these procedures are effective when used during routine 
production. </statement>
 <statement> Equipment cleanliness can be monitored by analytical testing and visual 
examination, where feasible. </statement>
 <statement> Visual inspection can allow detection of gross 
contamination concentrated in small areas that could otherwise go undetected by 
sampling and/or analysis. </statement>
 
 
 
 </regulation>
 </subsection>
<subsection> <subsection_title> 12.8  Validation of Analytical Methods </subsection_title>
 
 
<regulation> <statement> 12.80  Analytical methods should be validated unless the method employed is 
included in the relevant pharmacopoeia or other recognised standard reference. </statement>
 <statement> The 
suitability of all testing methods used should nonetheless be verified under actual 
conditions of use and documented. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.81  Methods should be validated to include consideration of characteristics 
included within the ICH guidelines on validation of analytical methods. </statement>
 <statement> The degree of 
analytical validation performed should reflect the purpose of the analysis and the 
stage of the API production process. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.82  Appropriate qualification of analytical equipment should be considered before 
starting validation of analytical methods. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 12.83  Complete records should be maintained of any modification of a validated 
analytical method. </statement>
 <statement> Such records should include the reason for the modification and 
appropriate data to verify that the modification produces results that are as accurate 
and reliable as the established method. </statement>
 
 
 
 </regulation>
 </subsection>
 </section>
<section> <section_title> 13  Change Control </section_title>
 
 
13.10  A formal change control system should be established to evaluate all changes 
that may affect the production and control of the intermediate or API. 
 
 39
13.11  Written procedures should provide for the identification, documentation, 
appropriate review, and approval of changes in raw materials, specifications, 
analytical methods, facilities, support systems, equipment (including computer 
hardware), processing steps, labelling and packaging materials, and computer 
software. 
 
13.12  Any proposals for GMP relevant changes should be drafted, reviewed, and 
approved by the appropriate organisational units, and reviewed and approved by the 
quality unit(s). 
 
13.13  The potential impact of the proposed change on the quality of the intermediate 
or API should be evaluated. A classification procedure may help in determining the 
level of testing, validation, and documentation needed to justify changes to a validated 
process. Changes can be classified (e.g. as minor or major) depending on the nature 
and extent of the changes, and the effects these changes may impart on the process. 
Scientific judgement should determine what additional testing and validation studies 
are appropriate to justify a change in a validated process. 
 
13.14  When implementing approved changes, measures should be taken to ensure 
that all documents affected by the changes are revised. 
 
13.15  After the change has been implemented, there should be an evaluation of the 
first batches produced or tested under the change. 
 
13.16  The potential for critical changes to affect established retest or expiry dates 
should be evaluated. If necessary, samples of the intermediate or API produced by the 
modified process can be placed on an accelerated stability program and/or can be 
added to the stability monitoring program. 
13.17  Current dosage form manufacturers should be notified of changes from 
established production and process control procedures that can impact the quality of 
the API.

<subsection> <subsection_title> 14.1  Rejection </subsection_title>
 
 
<regulation> <statement> 14.10  Intermediates and APIs failing to meet established specifications should be 
identified as such and quarantined. </statement>
 <statement> These intermediates or APIs can be reprocessed or 
reworked as described below. </statement>
 <statement> The final disposition of rejected materials should be 
recorded. </statement>
 
 
 
 </regulation>
 </subsection>
<subsection> <subsection_title> 14.2  Reprocessing </subsection_title>
 
 
<regulation> <statement> 14.20  Introducing an intermediate or API, including one that does not conform to 
standards or specifications, back into the process and reprocessing by repeating a 
crystallization step or other appropriate chemical or physical manipulation steps (e.g., 
distillation, filtration, chromatography, milling) that are part of the established 
manufacturing process is generally considered acceptable. </statement>
 <statement> However, if such 
 40
reprocessing is used for a majority of batches, such reprocessing should be included 
as part of the standard manufacturing process. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 14.21  Continuation of a process step after an in-process control test has shown that 
the step is incomplete is considered to be part of the normal process. </statement>
 <statement> This is not 
considered to be reprocessing. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 14.22  Introducing unreacted material back into a process and repeating a chemical 
reaction is considered to be reprocessing unless it is part of the established process. </statement>
 
<statement> Such reprocessing should be preceded by careful evaluation to ensure that the quality 
of the intermediate or API is not adversely impacted due to the potential formation of 
by-products and over-reacted materials. </statement>
 
 
 
 </regulation>
 </subsection>
<subsection> <subsection_title> 14.3 Reworking </subsection_title>
 
 
<regulation> <statement> 14.30  Before a decision is taken to rework batches that do not conform to established 
standards or specifications, an investigation into the reason for non-conformance 
should be performed. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 14.31  Batches that have been reworked should be subjected to appropriate 
evaluation, testing, stability testing if warranted, and documentation to show that the 
reworked product is of equivalent quality to that produced by the original process. </statement>
 
<statement> Concurrent validation is often the appropriate validation approach for rework 
procedures. </statement>
 <statement> This allows a protocol to define the rework procedure, how it will be 
carried out, and the expected results. </statement>
 <statement> If there is only one batch to be reworked, then a 
report can be written and the batch released once it is found to be acceptable. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 14.32  Procedures should provide for comparing the impurity profile of each 
reworked batch against batches manufactured by the established process. </statement>
 <statement> Where 
routine analytical methods are inadequate to characterize the reworked batch, 
additional methods should be used. </statement>
 
 
 
 </regulation>
 </subsection>
<subsection> <subsection_title> 14.4  Recovery of Materials and Solvents </subsection_title>
 
 
<regulation> <statement> 14.40  Recovery (e.g. from mother liquor or filtrates) of reactants, intermediates, or 
the API is considered acceptable, provided that approved procedures exist for the 
recovery and the recovered materials meet specifications suitable for their intended 
use. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 14.41  Solvents can be recovered and reused in the same processes or in different 
processes, provided that the recovery procedures are controlled and monitored to 
ensure that solvents meet appropriate standards before reuse or co-mingling with 
other approved materials. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 14.42  Fresh and recovered solvents and reagents can be combined if adequate testing 
has shown their suitability for all manufacturing processes in which they may be used. </statement>
 
 
 41
 </regulation>
<regulation> 14.43  The use of recovered solvents, mother liquors, and other recovered materials 
should be adequately documented.

<regulation> <statement> 14.50  Returned intermediates or APIs should be identified as such and quarantined. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 14.51  If the conditions under which returned intermediates or APIs have been stored 
or shipped before or during their return or the condition of their containers casts doubt 
on their quality, the returned intermediates or APIs should be reprocessed, reworked, 
or destroyed, as appropriate. </statement>

manufactured by cell culture or fermentation using natural or recombinant organisms 
and that have not been covered adequately in the previous sections. </statement>
 <statement> It is not intended 
to be a stand-alone Section. </statement>
 <statement> In general, the GMP principles in the other sections of

 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 18.11  The term “biotechnological process” (biotech) refers to the use of cells or 
organisms that have been generated or modified by recombinant DNA, hybridoma or 
other technology to produce APIs. </statement>
 <statement> The APIs produced by biotechnological processes 
normally consist of high molecular weight substances, such as proteins and 
polypeptides, for which specific guidance is given in this Section. </statement>
 <statement> Certain APIs of low 
molecular weight, such as antibiotics, amino acids, vitamins, and carbohydrates, can 
also be produced by recombinant DNA technology.The level of control for these 
types of APIs is similar to that employed for classical fermentation. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 18.12  The term “classical fermentation” refers to processes that use microorganisms 
existing in nature and/or modified by conventional methods (e.g. irradiation or 
chemical mutagenesis) to produce APIs. </statement>
 <statement> APIs produced by “classical fermentation” 
are normally low molecular weight products such as antibiotics, amino acids, 
vitamins, and carbohydrates. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 18.13  Production of APIs or intermediates from cell culture or fermentation involves 
biological processes such as cultivation of cells or extraction and purification of 
material from living organisms. </statement>
 <statement> Note that there may be additional process steps, such 
as physicochemical modification, that are part of the manufacturing process. </statement>
 <statement> The raw 
materials used (media, buffer components) may provide the potential for growth of 
microbiological contaminants. </statement>
 
<statement> Depending on the source, method of preparation, and the intended use of the API or 
intermediate, control of bioburden, viral contamination, and/or endotoxins during 
manufacturing and monitoring of the process at appropriate stages may be necessary. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 18.14  Appropriate controls should be established at all stages of manufacturing to 
assure intermediate and/or API quality. </statement>
 <statement> While this Guide starts at the cell 
culture/fermentation step, prior steps (e.g. cell banking) should be performed under 
appropriate process controls. </statement>
 <statement> This Guide covers cell culture/fermentation from the 
point at which a vial of the cell bank is retrieved for use in manufacturing. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 18.15  Appropriate equipment and environmental controls should be used to 
minimize the risk of contamination. </statement>
 <statement> The acceptance criteria for quality of the

environment and the frequency of monitoring should depend on the step in production 
and the production conditions (open, closed, or contained systems). </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 18.16  In general, process controls should take into account: </statement>
 
 
<statement> - Maintenance of the Working Cell Bank (where appropriate); 
- Proper inoculation and expansion of the culture; 
- Control of the critical operating parameters during fermentation/cell culture; 
- Monitoring of the process for cell growth, viability (for most cell culture 
processes) and productivity where appropriate; 
- Harvest and purification procedures that remove cells, cellular debris and 
media components while protecting the intermediate or API from 
contamination (particularly of a microbiological nature) and from loss of 
quality; 
- Monitoring of bioburden and, where needed, endotoxin levels at appropriate 
stages of production; and 
- Viral safety concerns as described in ICH Guideline Q5A Quality of 
Biotechnological Products: Viral Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology 
Products Derived from Cell Lines of Human or Animal Origin. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 18.17  Where appropriate, the removal of media components, host cell proteins, other 
process-related impurities, product-related impurities and contaminants should be 
demonstrated. </statement>

cellular components after disruption, should be performed in equipment and areas 
designed to minimize the risk of contamination. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 18.41  Harvest and purification procedures that remove or inactivate the producing

<regulation> <statement> 19.10  Not all the controls in the previous sections of this Guide are appropriate for 
the manufacture of a new API for investigational use during its development. </statement>
 <statement> Section 
19 provides specific guidance unique to these circumstances. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 19.11  The controls used in the manufacture of APIs for use in clinical trials should 
be consistent with the stage of development of the drug product incorporating the 
API. </statement>
 <statement> Process and test procedures should be flexible to provide for changes as 
knowledge of the process increases and clinical testing of a drug product progresses 
from pre-clinical stages through clinical stages. </statement>
 <statement> Once drug development reaches the 
stage where the API is produced for use in drug products intended for clinical trials, 
manufacturers should ensure that APIs are manufactured in suitable facilities using 
appropriate production and control procedures to ensure the quality of the API. </statement>
 
 49
 </regulation>
 </subsection>
<subsection> 19.2  Quality 
 
<regulation> <statement> 19.20  Appropriate GMP concepts should be applied in the production of APIs for 
use in clinical trials with a suitable mechanism of approval of each batch. </statement>
 
 
 </regulation>
<regulation> <statement> 19.21  A quality unit(s) independent from production should be established for the 
approval or rejection of each batch of API for use in clinical trials. </statement>

 </subsection>
<subsection> <subsection_title> 19.4  Control of Raw Materials </subsection_title>
 
 
<regulation> <statement> 19.40  Raw materials used in production of APIs for use in clinical trials should be 
evaluated by testing, or received with a supplier’s analysis and subjected to identity 
testing. </statement>
 <statement> When a material is considered hazardous, a supplier's analysis should suffice. </statement>
