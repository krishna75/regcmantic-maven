    <sentence count="367"> Prospective validation performed on an API process should be  completed before the commercial distribution of the final drug product manufactured  from that API. </sentence>
    <sentence count="368"> Concurrent validation can be conducted when data from replicate production  runs are unavailable because only a limited number of API batches have been  produced, API batches are produced infrequently, or API batches are produced by a  validated process that has been modified. </sentence>
    <sentence count="369"> Prior to the completion of concurrent  validation, batches can be released and used in final drug product for commercial  distribution based on thorough monitoring and testing of the API batches. </sentence>
    <sentence count="370"> An exception can be made for retrospective validation for well established  processes that have been used without significant changes to API quality due to  changes in raw materials, equipment, systems, facilities, or the production process. </sentence>
    <sentence count="371"> This validation approach may be used where: </sentence>
    <sentence count="372"> Critical quality attributes and critical process parameters have been identified;  (2) Appropriate in-process acceptance criteria and controls have been established;  (3) There have not been significant process/product failures attributable to causes  other than operator error or equipment failures unrelated to equipment suitability; and  (4) Impurity profiles have been established for the existing API. </sentence>
    <sentence count="373"> Batches selected for retrospective validation should be representative of all  batches made during the review period, including any batches that failed to meet  specifications, and should be sufficient in number to demonstrate process consistency. </sentence>
    <sentence count="374"> Retained samples can be tested to obtain data to retrospectively validate the process. </sentence>
    <sentence count="375"> The number of process runs for validation should depend on the complexity of  the process or the magnitude of the process change being considered. </sentence>
    <sentence count="376"> For prospective  and concurrent validation, three consecutive successful production batches should be  used as a guide, but there may be situations where additional process runs are  warranted to prove consistency of the process (e.g., complex API processes or API  processes with prolonged completion times). </sentence>
    <sentence count="377"> For retrospective validation, generally   37 data from ten to thirty consecutive batches should be examined to assess process  consistency, but fewer batches can be examined if justified. </sentence>
    <sentence count="378"> Critical process parameters should be controlled and monitored during process  validation studies. </sentence>
    <sentence count="379"> Process parameters unrelated to quality, such as variables  controlled to minimize energy consumption or equipment use, need not be included in  the process validation. </sentence>
    <sentence count="380"> Process validation should confirm that the impurity profile for each API is  within the limits specified. </sentence>
    <sentence count="381"> The impurity profile should be comparable to or better  than historical data and, where applicable, the profile determined during process  development or for batches used for pivotal clinical and toxicological studies. </sentence>
    <sentence count="382"> Systems and processes should be periodically evaluated to verify that they are  still operating in a valid manner. </sentence>
    <sentence count="383"> Where no significant changes have been made to the  system or process, and a quality review confirms that the system or process is  consistently producing material meeting its specifications, there is normally no need  for revalidation. </sentence>
    <sentence count="384"> Cleaning procedures should normally be validated. </sentence>
    <sentence count="385"> In general, cleaning  validation should be directed to situations or process steps where contamination or  carryover of materials poses the greatest risk to API quality. </sentence>
    <sentence count="386"> For example, in early  production it may be unnecessary to validate equipment cleaning procedures where  residues are removed by subsequent purification steps. </sentence>
    <sentence count="387"> Validation of cleaning procedures should reflect actual equipment usage  patterns. </sentence>
    <sentence count="388"> If various APIs or intermediates are manufactured in the same equipment  and the equipment is cleaned by the same process, a representative intermediate or  API can be selected for cleaning validation. </sentence>
    <sentence count="389"> This selection should be based on the  solubility and difficulty of cleaning and the calculation of residue limits based on  potency, toxicity, and stability. </sentence>
    <sentence count="390"> The cleaning validation protocol should describe the equipment to be cleaned,  procedures, materials, acceptable cleaning levels, parameters to be monitored and  controlled, and analytical methods. </sentence>
    <sentence count="391"> The protocol should also indicate the type of  samples to be obtained and how they are collected and labelled. </sentence>
    <sentence count="392"> Sampling should include swabbing, rinsing, or alternative methods (e.g., direct  extraction), as appropriate, to detect both insoluble and soluble residues. </sentence>
    <sentence count="393"> The  sampling methods used should be capable of quantitatively measuring levels of  residues remaining on the equipment surfaces after cleaning. </sentence>
    <sentence count="394"> Swab sampling may be  impractical when product contact surfaces are not easily accessible due to equipment  design and/or process limitations (e.g., inner surfaces of hoses, transfer pipes, reactor  tanks with small ports or handling toxic materials, and small intricate equipment such  as micronizers and microfluidizers). </sentence>
    <sentence count="395"> </sentence>
    <sentence count="396"> Validated analytical methods having sensitivity to detect residues or  contaminants should be used. </sentence>
    <sentence count="397"> The detection limit for each analytical method should  be sufficiently sensitive to detect the established acceptable level of the residue or  contaminant. </sentence>
    <sentence count="398"> The method’s attainable recovery level should be established. </sentence>
    <sentence count="399"> Residue  limits should be practical, achievable, verifiable and based on the most deleterious  residue. </sentence>
    <sentence count="400"> Limits can be established based on the minimum known pharmacological,  toxicological, or physiological activity of the API or its most deleterious component. </sentence>
    <sentence count="401"> Equipment cleaning/sanitization studies should address microbiological and  endotoxin contamination for those processes where there is a need to reduce total  microbiological count or endotoxins in the API, or other processes where such  contamination could be of concern (e.g., non-sterile APIs used to manufacture sterile  products). </sentence>
    <sentence count="402"> Cleaning procedures should be monitored at appropriate intervals after  validation to ensure that these procedures are effective when used during routine  production. </sentence>
    <sentence count="403"> Equipment cleanliness can be monitored by analytical testing and visual  examination, where feasible. </sentence>
    <sentence count="404"> Visual inspection can allow detection of gross  contamination concentrated in small areas that could otherwise go undetected by  sampling and/or analysis. </sentence>
    <sentence count="405"> Analytical methods should be validated unless the method employed is  included in the relevant pharmacopoeia or other recognised standard reference. </sentence>
    <sentence count="406"> The  suitability of all testing methods used should nonetheless be verified under actual  conditions of use and documented. </sentence>
    <sentence count="407"> Methods should be validated to include consideration of characteristics  included within the ICH guidelines on validation of analytical methods. </sentence>
    <sentence count="408"> The degree of  analytical validation performed should reflect the purpose of the analysis and the  stage of the API production process. </sentence>
    <sentence count="409"> Appropriate qualification of analytical equipment should be considered before  starting validation of analytical methods. </sentence>
    <sentence count="410"> Complete records should be maintained of any modification of a validated  analytical method. </sentence>
    <sentence count="411"> Such records should include the reason for the modification and  appropriate data to verify that the modification produces results that are as accurate  and reliable as the established method. </sentence>
    <sentence count="412"> Intermediates and APIs failing to meet established specifications should be  identified as such and quarantined. </sentence>
    <sentence count="413"> These intermediates or APIs can be reprocessed or  reworked as described below. </sentence>
    <sentence count="414"> The final disposition of rejected materials should be  recorded. </sentence>
    <sentence count="415"> Introducing an intermediate or API, including one that does not conform to  standards or specifications, back into the process and reprocessing by repeating a  crystallization step or other appropriate chemical or physical manipulation steps (e.g.,  distillation, filtration, chromatography, milling) that are part of the established  manufacturing process is generally considered acceptable. </sentence>
    <sentence count="416"> However, if such   40 reprocessing is used for a majority of batches, such reprocessing should be included  as part of the standard manufacturing process. </sentence>
    <sentence count="417"> Continuation of a process step after an in-process control test has shown that  the step is incomplete is considered to be part of the normal process. </sentence>
    <sentence count="418"> This is not  considered to be reprocessing. </sentence>
    <sentence count="419"> Introducing unreacted material back into a process and repeating a chemical  reaction is considered to be reprocessing unless it is part of the established process. </sentence>
    <sentence count="420"> Such reprocessing should be preceded by careful evaluation to ensure that the quality  of the intermediate or API is not adversely impacted due to the potential formation of  by-products and over-reacted materials. </sentence>
    <sentence count="421"> Before a decision is taken to rework batches that do not conform to established  standards or specifications, an investigation into the reason for non-conformance  should be performed. </sentence>
    <sentence count="422"> Batches that have been reworked should be subjected to appropriate  evaluation, testing, stability testing if warranted, and documentation to show that the  reworked product is of equivalent quality to that produced by the original process. </sentence>
    <sentence count="423"> Concurrent validation is often the appropriate validation approach for rework  procedures. </sentence>
    <sentence count="424"> This allows a protocol to define the rework procedure, how it will be  carried out, and the expected results. </sentence>
    <sentence count="425"> If there is only one batch to be reworked, then a  report can be written and the batch released once it is found to be acceptable. </sentence>
    <sentence count="426"> Procedures should provide for comparing the impurity profile of each  reworked batch against batches manufactured by the established process. </sentence>
    <sentence count="427"> Where  routine analytical methods are inadequate to characterize the reworked batch,  additional methods should be used. </sentence>
    <sentence count="428"> Recovery (e.g. from mother liquor or filtrates) of reactants, intermediates, or  the API is considered acceptable, provided that approved procedures exist for the  recovery and the recovered materials meet specifications suitable for their intended  use. </sentence>
    <sentence count="429"> Solvents can be recovered and reused in the same processes or in different  processes, provided that the recovery procedures are controlled and monitored to  ensure that solvents meet appropriate standards before reuse or co-mingling with  other approved materials. </sentence>
    <sentence count="430"> Fresh and recovered solvents and reagents can be combined if adequate testing  has shown their suitability for all manufacturing processes in which they may be used. </sentence>
