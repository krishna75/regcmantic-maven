1 Introduction 

This guideline was published in November 2000 as Annex 18 to the GMP Guide 
reflecting the EU’s agreement to ICH Q7A and has been used by manufacturers and 
GMP inspectorates on a voluntary basis. Article 46 (f) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
Article 50 (f) of Directive 2001/82/EC; as amended by Directives 2004/27/EC and 
2004/28/EC respectively, place new obligations on manufacturing authorisation 
holders to use only active substances that have been manufactured in accordance with 
Good Manufacturing Practice for starting materials. The directives go on to say that 
the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice for active substances are to be adopted 
as detailed guidelines. Member States have agreed that the text of former Annex 18 
should form the basis of the detailed guidelines to create Part II of the GMP Guide. 

1.1 Objective 
These guidelines are intended to provide guidance regarding Good Manufacturing 
Practice (GMP) for the manufacture of active substances under an appropriate system 
for managing quality. It is also intended to help ensure that active substances meet the 
requirements for quality and purity that they purport or are represented to possess. 

In these guidelines “manufacturing” includes all operations of receipt of materials, 
production, packaging, repackaging, labeling, relabelling, quality control, release, 
storage and distribution of active substances and the related controls. The term 
“should” indicates recommendations that are expected to apply unless shown to be 
inapplicable, modified in any relevant annexes to the GMP Guide, or replaced by an 
alternative demonstrated to provide at least an equivalent level of quality assurance. 

The GMP Guide as a whole does not cover safety aspects for the personnel engaged 
in manufacture, nor aspects of protection of the environment. These controls are 
inherent responsibilities of the manufacturer and are governed by other parts of the 
legislation. 

These guidelines are not intended to define registration requirements or modify 
pharmacopoeial requirements and do not affect the ability of the responsible 
competent authority to establish specific registration requirements regarding active 
substances within the context of marketing/manufacturing authorisations. All 
commitments in registration documents must be met. 

1.2 Scope 
These guidelines apply to the manufacture of active substances for medicinal products 
for both human and veterinary use. They apply to the manufacture of sterile active 
substances only up to the point immediately prior to the active substance being 
rendered sterile. The sterilisation and aseptic processing of sterile active substances 
are not covered, but should be performed in accordance with the principles and 
guidelines of GMP as laid down in Directive 2003/94/EC and interpreted in the GMP 
Guide including its Annex 1. 

In the case of ectoparasiticides for veterinary use, other standards than these 
guidelines, that ensure that the material is of appropriate quality, may be used. 

These guidelines exclude, whole blood and plasma, as Directive 2002/98/EC and the 
technical requirements supporting that directive lay down the detailed requirements 
for the collection and testing of blood, however, it does include active substances that 


are produced using blood or plasma as raw materials. Finally, these guidelines do not 
apply to bulk-packaged medicinal products. They apply to all other active starting 
materials subject to any derogations described in the annexes to the GMP Guide, in 
particular Annexes 2 to 7 where supplementary guidance for certain types of active 
substance may be found. The annexes will consequently undergo a review but in the 
meantime and only until this review is complete, manufacturers may choose to 
continue to use Part I of the basic requirements and the relevant annexes for products 
covered by those annexes, or may already apply Part II. 

Section 19 contains guidance that only applies to the manufacture of active substances 
used in the production of investigational medicinal products although it should be 
noted that its application in this case, although recommended, is not required by 
Community legislation. 

An “Active Substance Starting Material” is a raw material, intermediate, or an active 
substance that is used in the production of an active substance and that is incorporated 
as a significant structural fragment into the structure of the active substance. An 
Active Substance Starting Material can be an article of commerce, a material 
purchased from one or more suppliers under contract or commercial agreement, or 
produced in-house. Active Substance Starting Materials normally have defined 
chemical properties and structure. 

The manufacturer should designate and document the rationale for the point at which 
production of the active substance begins. For synthetic processes, this is known as 
the point at which "Active Substance Starting Materials" are entered into the process. 
For other processes (e.g. fermentation, extraction, purification, etc), this rationale 
should be established on a case-by-case basis. Table 1 gives guidance on the point at 
which the Active Substance Starting Material is normally introduced into the process. 
From this point on, appropriate GMP as defined in these guidelines should be applied 
to these intermediate and/or active substance manufacturing steps. This would include 
the validation of critical process steps determined to impact the quality of the active 
substance. However, it should be noted that the fact that a manufacturer chooses to 
validate a process step does not necessarily define that step as critical. The guidance 
in this document would normally be applied to the steps shown in grey in Table 1. It 
does not imply that all steps shown should be completed. The stringency of GMP in 
active substance manufacturing should increase as the process proceeds from early 
steps to final steps, purification, and packaging. Physical processing of active 
substances, such as granulation, coating or physical manipulation of particle size (e.g. 
milling, micronising), should be conducted at least to the standards of these 
guidelines. These guidelines do not apply to steps prior to the first introduction of the 
defined "Active Substance Starting Material". 

In the remainder of this guideline the term Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) is 
used repeatedly and should be considered interchangeable with the term “Active 
Substance”. The glossary in section 20 of Part II should only be applied in the 
context of Part II. Some of the same terms are already defined in Part I of the GMP 
guide and these therefore should only be applied in the context of Part I.

2 Quality Management 

2.1 Principles 
2.10 Quality should be the responsibility of all persons involved in manufacturing. 
2.11 Each manufacturer should establish, document, and implement an effective 
system for managing quality that involves the active participation of management and 
appropriate manufacturing personnel. 
2.12 The system for managing quality should encompass the organisational 
structure, procedures, processes and resources, as well as activities necessary to 
ensure confidence that the API will meet its intended specifications for quality and 
purity. All quality related activities should be defined and documented. 
2.13 There should be a quality unit(s) that is independent of production and that 
fulfills both quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) responsibilities. This can 
be in the form of separate QA and QC units or a single individual or group, depending 
upon the size and structure of the organization. 
2.14 The persons authorised to release intermediates and APIs should be specified. 
2.15 All quality related activities should be recorded at the time they are performed. 
2.16 Any deviation from established procedures should be documented and 
explained. Critical deviations should be investigated, and the investigation and its 
conclusions should be documented. 
2.17 No materials should be released or used before the satisfactory completion of 
evaluation by the quality unit(s) unless there are appropriate systems in place to allow 
for such use (e.g. release under quarantine as described in Section 10.20 or the use of 
raw materials or intermediates pending completion of evaluation). 
2.18 Procedures should exist for notifying responsible management in a timely 
manner of regulatory inspections, serious GMP deficiencies, product defects and 
related actions (e.g. quality related complaints, recalls, regulatory actions, etc.). 
2.2 Responsibilities of the Quality Unit(s) 
2.20 The quality unit(s) should be involved in all quality-related matters. 
2.21 The quality unit(s) should review and approve all appropriate quality-related 
documents. 
2.22 The main responsibilities of the independent quality unit(s) should not be 
delegated. These responsibilities should be described in writing and should include 
but not necessarily be limited to: 

1. 
Releasing or rejecting all APIs. Releasing or rejecting intermediates for 
use outside the control of the manufacturing company; 
2. 
Establishing a system to release or reject raw materials, intermediates, 
packaging and labelling materials; 
3. 
Reviewing completed batch production and laboratory control records 
of critical process steps before release of the API for distribution; 
4. 
Making sure that critical deviations are investigated and resolved; 
5. 
Approving all specifications and master production instructions; 
6. 
Approving all procedures impacting the quality of intermediates or 
APIs; 
7. 
Making sure that internal audits (self-inspections) are performed; 
8. 
Approving intermediate and API contract manufacturers; 
9. 
Approving changes that potentially impact intermediate or API quality; 
10. 
Reviewing and approving validation protocols and reports; 
11. 
Making sure that quality related complaints are investigated and 
resolved; 
12. 
Making sure that effective systems are used for maintaining and 
calibrating critical equipment; 
13. 
Making sure that materials are appropriately tested and the results are 
reported; 
14. 
Making sure that there is stability data to support retest or expiry dates 
and storage conditions on APIs and/or intermediates where 
appropriate; and 
15. 
Performing product quality reviews (as defined in Section 2.5) 
2.3 Responsibility for Production Activities 
The responsibility for production activities should be described in writing, and should 
include but not necessarily be limited to: 

1. 
Preparing, reviewing, approving and distributing the instructions for 
the production of intermediates or APIs according to written 
procedures; 
2. 
Producing APIs and, when appropriate, intermediates according to pre-
approved instructions; 
3. 
Reviewing all production batch records and ensuring that these are 
completed and signed; 
4. 
Making sure that all production deviations are reported and evaluated 
and that critical deviations are investigated and the conclusions are 
recorded; 

5. 
Making sure that production facilities are clean and when appropriate 
disinfected; 
6. 
Making sure that the necessary calibrations are performed and records 
kept; 
7. 
Making sure that the premises and equipment are maintained and 
records kept; 
8. 
Making sure that validation protocols and reports are reviewed and 
approved; 
9. 
Evaluating proposed changes in product, process or equipment; and 
10. 
Making sure that new and, when appropriate, modified facilities and 
equipment are qualified. 
2.4 Internal Audits (Self Inspection) 
2.40 In order to verify compliance with the principles of GMP for APIs, regular 
internal audits should be performed in accordance with an approved schedule. 
2.41 Audit findings and corrective actions should be documented and brought to 
the attention of responsible management of the firm. Agreed corrective actions should 
be completed in a timely and effective manner. 
2.5 Product Quality Review 
2.50 Regular quality reviews of APIs should be conducted with the objective of 
verifying the consistency of the process. Such reviews should normally be conducted 
and documented annually and should include at least: 
- A review of critical in-process control and critical API test results; 
- A review of all batches that failed to meet established specification(s); 
- A review of all critical deviations or non-conformances and related investigations; 
- A review of any changes carried out to the processes or analytical methods; 
- A review of results of the stability monitoring program; 
- A review of all quality-related returns, complaints and recalls; and 
- A review of adequacy of corrective actions. 
2.51 The results of this review should be evaluated and an assessment made of 
whether corrective action or any revalidation should be undertaken. Reasons for such 
corrective action should be documented. Agreed corrective actions should be 
completed in a timely and effective manner. 

3 Personnel 

3.1 Personnel Qualifications 
3.10 There should be an adequate number of personnel qualified by appropriate 
education, training and/or experience to perform and supervise the manufacture of 
intermediates and APIs. 
3.11 The responsibilities of all personnel engaged in the manufacture of 
intermediates and APIs should be specified in writing. 
3.12 Training should be regularly conducted by qualified individuals and should 
cover, at a minimum, the particular operations that the employee performs and GMP 
as it relates to the employee's functions. Records of training should be maintained. 
Training should be periodically assessed. 
3.2 Personnel Hygiene 
3.20 Personnel should practice good sanitation and health habits. 
3.21 Personnel should wear clean clothing suitable for the manufacturing activity 
with which they are involved and this clothing should be changed when appropriate. 
Additional protective apparel, such as head, face, hand, and arm coverings, should be 
worn when necessary, to protect intermediates and APIs from contamination. 
3.22 Personnel should avoid direct contact with intermediates or APIs. 
3.23 Smoking, eating, drinking, chewing and the storage of food should be 
restricted to certain designated areas separate from the manufacturing areas. 
3.24 Personnel suffering from an infectious disease or having open lesions on the 
exposed surface of the body should not engage in activities that could result in 
compromising the quality of APIs. Any person shown at any time (either by medical 
examination or supervisory observation) to have an apparent illness or open lesions 
should be excluded from activities where the health condition could adversely affect 
the quality of the APIs until the condition is corrected or qualified medical personnel 
determine that the person's inclusion would not jeopardize the safety or quality of the 
APIs. 

3.3 Consultants 
3.30 Consultants advising on the manufacture and control of intermediates or APIs 
should have sufficient education, training, and experience, or any combination 
thereof, to advise on the subject for which they are retained. 
3.31 Records should be maintained stating the name, address, qualifications, and 
type of service provided by these consultants. 
4 Buildings and Facilities 

4.1 Design and Construction 
4.10 Buildings and facilities used in the manufacture of intermediates and APIs 
should be located, designed, and constructed to facilitate cleaning, maintenance, and 
operations as appropriate to the type and stage of manufacture. Facilities should also 
be designed to minimize potential contamination. Where microbiological 
specifications have been established for the intermediate or API, facilities should also 
be designed to limit exposure to objectionable microbiological contaminants as 
appropriate. 
4.11 Buildings and facilities should have adequate space for the orderly placement 
of equipment and materials to prevent mix-ups and contamination. 
4.12 Where the equipment itself (e.g., closed or contained systems) provides 
adequate protection of the material, such equipment can be located outdoors. 
4.13 The flow of materials and personnel through the building or facilities should be 
designed to prevent mix-ups or contamination. 
4.14 There should be defined areas or other control systems for the following 
activities: 
-Receipt, identification, sampling, and quarantine of incoming materials, 
pending release or rejection; 

-Quarantine before release or rejection of intermediates and APIs; 

-Sampling of intermediates and APIs; 

-Holding rejected materials before further disposition (e.g., return, 
reprocessing or destruction) 

-Storage of released materials; 

-Production operations; 

-Packaging and labelling operations; and 

-Laboratory operations. 

4.15 Adequate, clean washing and toilet facilities should be provided for personnel. 
These washing facilities should be equipped with hot and cold water as appropriate, 

soap or detergent, air driers or single service towels. The washing and toilet facilities 
should be separate from, but easily accessible to, manufacturing areas. Adequate 
facilities for showering and/or changing clothes should be provided, when 
appropriate. 

4.16 Laboratory areas/operations should normally be separated from production 
areas. Some laboratory areas, in particular those used for in-process controls, can be 
located in production areas, provided the operations of the production process do not 
adversely affect the accuracy of the laboratory measurements, and the laboratory and 
its operations do not adversely affect the production process or intermediate or API. 
4.2 Utilities 
4.20 All utilities that could impact on product quality (e.g. steam, gases, 
compressed air, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning) should be qualified and 
appropriately monitored and action should be taken when limits are exceeded. 
Drawings for these utility systems should be available. 
4.21 Adequate ventilation, air filtration and exhaust systems should be provided, 
where appropriate. These systems should be designed and constructed to minimise 
risks of contamination and cross-contamination and should include equipment for 
control of air pressure, microorganisms (if appropriate), dust, humidity, and 
temperature, as appropriate to the stage of manufacture. Particular attention should be 
given to areas where APIs are exposed to the environment. 
4.22 If air is recirculated to production areas, appropriate measures should be taken 
to control risks of contamination and cross-contamination. 
4.23 Permanently installed pipework should be appropriately identified. This can be 
accomplished by identifying individual lines, documentation, computer control 
systems, or alternative means. Pipework should be located to avoid risks of 
contamination of the intermediate or API. 
4.24 Drains should be of adequate size and should be provided with an air break or 
a suitable device to prevent back-siphonage, when appropriate. 
4.3 Water 
4.30 Water used in the manufacture of APIs should be demonstrated to be suitable 
for its intended use. 
4.31 Unless otherwise justified, process water should, at a minimum, meet World 
Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for drinking (potable) water quality. 
4.32 If drinking (potable) water is insufficient to assure API quality, and tighter 
chemical and/or microbiological water quality specifications are called for, 
appropriate specifications for physical/chemical attributes, total microbial counts, 
objectionable organisms and/or endotoxins should be established. 

4.33 Where water used in the process is treated by the manufacturer to achieve a 
defined quality, the treatment process should be validated and monitored with 
appropriate action limits. 
4.34 Where the manufacturer of a non-sterile API either intends or claims that it is 
suitable for use in further processing to produce a sterile drug (medicinal) product, 
water used in the final isolation and purification steps should be monitored and 
controlled for total microbial counts, objectionable organisms, and endotoxins. 
4.4 Containment 
4.40 Dedicated production areas, which can include facilities, air handling 
equipment and/or process equipment, should be employed in the production of highly 
sensitizing materials, such as penicillins or cephalosporins. 
4.41 Dedicated production areas should also be considered when material of an 
infectious nature or high pharmacological activity or toxicity is involved (e.g., certain 
steroids or cytotoxic anti-cancer agents) unless validated inactivation and/or cleaning 
procedures are established and maintained. 
4.42 Appropriate measures should be established and implemented to prevent 
cross-contamination from personnel, materials, etc. moving from one dedicated area 
to another. 
4.43 Any production activities (including weighing, milling, or packaging) of 
highly toxic non-pharmaceutical materials such as herbicides and pesticides should 
not be conducted using the buildings and/or equipment being used for the production 
of APIs. Handling and storage of these highly toxic non-pharmaceutical materials 
should be separate from APIs. 
4.5 Lighting 
4.50 Adequate lighting should be provided in all areas to facilitate cleaning, 
maintenance, and proper operations. 
4.6 Sewage and Refuse 
4.60 Sewage, refuse, and other waste (e.g., solids, liquids, or gaseous by-products 
from manufacturing) in and from buildings and the immediate surrounding area 
should be disposed of in a safe, timely, and sanitary manner. Containers and/or pipes 
for waste material should be clearly identified. 
4.7 Sanitation and Maintenance 
4.70 Buildings used in the manufacture of intermediates and APIs should be 
properly maintained and repaired and kept in a clean condition. 

4.71 Written procedures should be established assigning responsibility for 
sanitation and describing the cleaning schedules, methods, equipment, and materials 
to be used in cleaning buildings and facilities. 
4.72 When necessary, written procedures should also be established for the use of 
suitable rodenticides, insecticides, fungicides, fumigating agents, and cleaning and 
sanitizing agents to prevent the contamination of equipment, raw materials, 
packaging/labelling materials, intermediates, and APIs. 
5 Process Equipment 

5.1 Design and Construction 
5.10 Equipment used in the manufacture of intermediates and APIs should be of 
appropriate design and adequate size, and suitably located for its intended use, 
cleaning, sanitization (where appropriate), and maintenance. 
5.11 Equipment should be constructed so that surfaces that contact raw materials, 
intermediates, or APIs do not alter the quality of the intermediates and APIs beyond 
the official or other established specifications. 
5.12 Production equipment should only be used within its qualified operating 
range. 
5.13 Major equipment (e.g., reactors, storage containers) and permanently installed 
processing lines used during the production of an intermediate or API should be 
appropriately identified. 
5.14 Any substances associated with the operation of equipment, such as lubricants, 
heating fluids or coolants, should not contact intermediates or APIs so as to alter their 
quality beyond the official or other established specifications. Any deviations from 
this should be evaluated to ensure that there are no detrimental effects upon the fitness 
for purpose of the material. Wherever possible, food grade lubricants and oils should 
be used. 
5.15 Closed or contained equipment should be used whenever appropriate. Where 
open equipment is used, or equipment is opened, appropriate precautions should be 
taken to minimize the risk of contamination. 
5.16 A set of current drawings should be maintained for equipment and critical 
installations (e.g., instrumentation and utility systems). 
5.2 Equipment Maintenance and Cleaning 
5.20 Schedules and procedures (including assignment of responsibility) should be 
established for the preventative maintenance of equipment. 

5.21 Written procedures should be established for cleaning of equipment and its 
subsequent release for use in the manufacture of intermediates and APIs. Cleaning 
procedures should contain sufficient details to enable operators to clean each type of 
equipment in a reproducible and effective manner. These procedures should include: 
-Assignment of responsibility for cleaning of equipment; 

-Cleaning schedules, including, where appropriate, sanitizing schedules; 

-A complete description of the methods and materials, including dilution of 
cleaning agents used to clean equipment; 

-When appropriate, instructions for disassembling and reassembling each 
article of equipment to ensure proper cleaning; 

-Instructions for the removal or obliteration of previous batch identification; 

-Instructions for the protection of clean equipment from contamination prior to 
use; 

-Inspection of equipment for cleanliness immediately before use, if practical; 
and 

-Establishing the maximum time that may elapse between the completion of 
processing and equipment cleaning, when appropriate. 

5.22 Equipment and utensils should be cleaned, stored, and, where appropriate, 
sanitized or sterilized to prevent contamination or carry-over of a material that would 
alter the quality of the intermediate or API beyond the official or other established 
specifications. 
5.23 Where equipment is assigned to continuous production or campaign 
production of successive batches of the same intermediate or API, equipment should 
be cleaned at appropriate intervals to prevent build-up and carry-over of contaminants 
(e.g. degradants or objectionable levels of micro-organisms). 
5.24 Non-dedicated equipment should be cleaned between production of different 
materials to prevent cross-contamination. 
5.25 Acceptance criteria for residues and the choice of cleaning procedures and 
cleaning agents should be defined and justified. 
5.26 Equipment should be identified as to its contents and its cleanliness status by 
appropriate means. 
5.3 Calibration 
5.30 Control, weighing, measuring, monitoring and test equipment that is critical 
for assuring the quality of intermediates or APIs should be calibrated according to 
written procedures and an established schedule. 

5.31 Equipment calibrations should be performed using standards traceable to 
certified standards, if existing. 
5.32 Records of these calibrations should be maintained. 
5.33 The current calibration status of critical equipment should be known and 
verifiable. 
5.34 Instruments that do not meet calibration criteria should not be used. 
5.35 Deviations from approved standards of calibration on critical instruments 
should be investigated to determine if these could have had an impact on the quality 
of the intermediate(s) or API(s) manufactured using this equipment since the last 
successful calibration. 
5.4 Computerized Systems 
5.40 GMP related computerized systems should be validated. The depth and scope 
of validation depends on the diversity, complexity and criticality of the computerized 
application. 
5.41 Appropriate installation qualification and operational qualification should 
demonstrate the suitability of computer hardware and software to perform assigned 
tasks. 
5.42 Commercially available software that has been qualified does not require the 
same level of testing. If an existing system was not validated at time of installation, a 
retrospective validation could be conducted if appropriate documentation is available. 
5.43 Computerized systems should have sufficient controls to prevent unauthorized 
access or changes to data. There should be controls to prevent omissions in data (e.g. 
system turned off and data not captured). There should be a record of any data change 
made, the previous entry, who made the change, and when the change was made. 
5.44 Written procedures should be available for the operation and maintenance of 
computerized systems. 
5.45 Where critical data are being entered manually, there should be an additional 
check on the accuracy of the entry. This can be done by a second operator or by the 
system itself. 
5.46 Incidents related to computerized systems that could affect the quality of 
intermediates or APIs or the reliability of records or test results should be recorded 
and investigated. 
5.47 Changes to the computerized system should be made according to a change 
procedure and should be formally authorized, documented and tested. Records should 
be kept of all changes, including modifications and enhancements made to the 

hardware, software and any other critical component of the system. These records 
should demonstrate that the system is maintained in a validated state. 

5.48 If system breakdowns or failures would result in the permanent loss of 
records, a back-up system should be provided. A means of ensuring data protection 
should be established for all computerized systems. 
5.49 Data can be recorded by a second means in addition to the computer system. 
6 Documentation and Records 

6.1 Documentation System and Specifications 
6.10 All documents related to the manufacture of intermediates or APIs should be 
prepared, reviewed, approved and distributed according to written procedures. Such 
documents can be in paper or electronic form. 
6.11 The issuance, revision, superseding and withdrawal of all documents should 
be controlled with maintenance of revision histories. 
6.12 A procedure should be established for retaining all appropriate documents 
(e.g., development history reports, scale-up reports, technical transfer reports, process 
validation reports, training records, production records, control records, and 
distribution records). The retention periods for these documents should be specified. 
6.13 All production, control, and distribution records should be retained for at least 
1 year after the expiry date of the batch. For APIs with retest dates, records should be 
retained for at least 3 years after the batch is completely distributed. 
6.14 When entries are made in records, these should be made indelibly in spaces 
provided for such entries, directly after performing the activities, and should identify 
the person making the entry. Corrections to entries should be dated and signed and 
leave the original entry still readable. 
6.15 During the retention period, originals or copies of records should be readily 
available at the establishment where the activities described in such records occurred. 
Records that can be promptly retrieved from another location by electronic or other 
means are acceptable. 
6.16 Specifications, instructions, procedures, and records can be retained either as 
originals or as true copies such as photocopies, microfilm, microfiche, or other 
accurate reproductions of the original records. Where reduction techniques such as 
microfilming or electronic records are used, suitable retrieval equipment and a means 
to produce a hard copy should be readily available. 
6.17 Specifications should be established and documented for raw materials, 
intermediates where necessary, APIs, and labelling and packaging materials. In 
addition, specifications may be appropriate for certain other materials, such as process 
aids, gaskets, or other materials used during the production of intermediates or APIs 

that could critically impact on quality. Acceptance criteria should be established and 
documented for in-process controls. 

6.18 If electronic signatures are used on documents, they should be authenticated 
and secure. 
6.2 
Equipment Cleaning and Use Record 
6.20 Records of major equipment use, cleaning, sanitization and/or sterilization and 
maintenance should show the date, time (if appropriate), product, and batch number 
of each batch processed in the equipment, and the person who performed the cleaning 
and maintenance. 
6.21 If equipment is dedicated to manufacturing one intermediate or API, then 
individual equipment records are not necessary if batches of the intermediate or API 
follow in traceable sequence. In cases where dedicated equipment is employed, the 
records of cleaning, maintenance, and use can be part of the batch record or 
maintained separately. 
6.3 
Records of Raw Materials, Intermediates, API Labelling and Packaging 
Materials 
6.30 
Records should be maintained including: 
-The name of the manufacturer, identity and quantity of each shipment of each 
batch of raw materials, intermediates or labelling and packaging materials for 
API's; the name of the supplier; the supplier's control number(s), if known, or 
other identification number; the number allocated on receipt; and the date of 
receipt; 

-The results of any test or examination performed and the conclusions derived 

from this; 
-Records tracing the use of materials; 
-Documentation of the examination and review of API labelling and packaging 

materials for conformity with established specifications; and 
-The final decision regarding rejected raw materials, intermediates or API 
labelling and packaging materials. 

6.31 Master (approved) labels should be maintained for comparison to issued 
labels. 
6.4 
Master Production Instructions (Master Production and Control 
Records) 
6.40 To ensure uniformity from batch to batch, master production instructions for 
each intermediate and API should be prepared, dated, and signed by one person and 
independently checked, dated, and signed by a person in the quality unit(s). 

6.41 Master production instructions should include: 
-The name of the intermediate or API being manufactured and an identifying 
document reference code, if applicable; 

-A complete list of raw materials and intermediates designated by names or 
codes sufficiently specific to identify any special quality characteristics; 

-An accurate statement of the quantity or ratio of each raw material or 
intermediate to be used, including the unit of measure. Where the quantity is 
not fixed, the calculation for each batch size or rate of production should be 
included. Variations to quantities should be included where they are justified; 

-The production location and major production equipment to be used; 

-Detailed production instructions, including the: 

-sequences to be followed, 

-ranges of process parameters to be used, 

-sampling instructions and in-process controls with their acceptance criteria, 
where appropriate, 

-time limits for completion of individual processing steps and/or the total 
process, where appropriate; and 

-expected yield ranges at appropriate phases of processing or time; 

-Where appropriate, special notations and precautions to be followed, or cross 
references to these; and 

-The instructions for storage of the intermediate or API to assure its suitability 
for use, including the labelling and packaging materials and special storage 
conditions with time limits, where appropriate. 

6.5 Batch Production Records (Batch Production and Control Records) 
6.50 Batch production records should be prepared for each intermediate and API 
and should include complete information relating to the production and control of 
each batch. The batch production record should be checked before issuance to assure 
that it is the correct version and a legible accurate reproduction of the appropriate 
master production instruction. If the batch production record is produced from a 
separate part of the master document, that document should include a reference to the 
current master production instruction being used. 
6.51 These records should be numbered with a unique batch or identification 
number, dated and signed when issued. In continuous production, the product code 
together with the date and time can serve as the unique identifier until the final 
number is allocated. 
6.52 Documentation of completion of each significant step in the batch production 
records (batch production and control records) should include: 
-Dates and, when appropriate, times; 


-Identity of major equipment (e.g., reactors, driers, mills, etc.) used; 

-Specific identification of each batch, including weights, measures, and batch 
numbers of raw materials, intermediates, or any reprocessed materials used 
during manufacturing; 

-Actual results recorded for critical process parameters; 

-Any sampling performed; 

-Signatures of the persons performing and directly supervising or checking 
each critical step in the operation; 

-In-process and laboratory test results; 

-Actual yield at appropriate phases or times; 

-Description of packaging and label for intermediate or API; 

-Representative label of API or intermediate if made commercially available; 

-Any deviation noted, its evaluation, investigation conducted (if appropriate) 
or reference to that investigation if stored separately; and 

-Results of release testing. 

6.53 Written procedures should be established and followed for investigating 
critical deviations or the failure of a batch of intermediate or API to meet 
specifications. The investigation should extend to other batches that may have been 
associated with the specific failure or deviation. 
6.6 Laboratory Control Records 
6.60 Laboratory control records should include complete data derived from all tests 
conducted to ensure compliance with established specifications and standards, 
including examinations and assays, as follows: 
-A description of samples received for testing, including the material name or 
source, batch number or other distinctive code, date sample was taken, and, 
where appropriate, the quantity and date the sample was received for testing; 

-A statement of or reference to each test method used; 

-A statement of the weight or measure of sample used for each test as 
described by the method; data on or cross-reference to the preparation and 
testing of reference standards, reagents and standard solutions, 

-A complete record of all raw data generated during each test, in addition to 
graphs, charts, and spectra from laboratory instrumentation, properly 
identified to show the specific material and batch tested; 

-A record of all calculations performed in connection with the test, including, 
for example, units of measure, conversion factors, and equivalency factors; 

-A statement of the test results and how they compare with established 
acceptance criteria; 


-The signature of the person who performed each test and the date(s) the tests 
were performed; and 

-The date and signature of a second person showing that the original records 
have been reviewed for accuracy, completeness, and compliance with 
established standards. 

6.61 Complete records should also be maintained for: 
-Any modifications to an established analytical method, 

-Periodic calibration of laboratory instruments, apparatus, gauges, and 
recording devices; 

-All stability testing performed on APIs; and 

-Out-of-specification (OOS) investigations. 

6.7 Batch Production Record Review 
6.70 Written procedures should be established and followed for the review and 
approval of batch production and laboratory control records, including packaging and 
labelling, to determine compliance of the intermediate or API with established 
specifications before a batch is released or distributed. 
6.71 Batch production and laboratory control records of critical process steps 
should be reviewed and approved by the quality unit(s) before an API batch is 
released or distributed. Production and laboratory control records of non-critical 
process steps can be reviewed by qualified production personnel or other units 
following procedures approved by the quality unit(s). 
6.72 All deviation, investigation, and OOS reports should be reviewed as part of the 
batch record review before the batch is released. 
6.73 The quality unit(s) can delegate to the production unit the responsibility and 
authority for release of intermediates, except for those shipped outside the control of 
the manufacturing company. 
7 Materials Management 

7.1 General Controls 
7.10 There should be written procedures describing the receipt, identification, 
quarantine, storage, handling, sampling, testing, and approval or rejection of 
materials. 
7.11 Manufacturers of intermediates and/or APIs should have a system for 
evaluating the suppliers of critical materials. 

7.12 Materials should be purchased against an agreed specification, from a supplier 
or suppliers approved by the quality unit(s). 
7.13 If the supplier of a critical material is not the manufacturer of that material, the 
name and address of that manufacturer should be known by the intermediate and/or 
API manufacturer. 
7.14 Changing the source of supply of critical raw materials should be treated 
according to Section 13, Change Control. 
7.2 Receipt and Quarantine 
7.20 Upon receipt and before acceptance, each container or grouping of containers 
of materials should be examined visually for correct labelling (including correlation 
between the name used by the supplier and the in-house name, if these are different), 
container damage, broken seals and evidence of tampering or contamination. 
Materials should be held under quarantine until they have been sampled, examined or 
tested as appropriate, and released for use. 
7.21 Before incoming materials are mixed with existing stocks (e.g., solvents or 
stocks in silos), they should be identified as correct, tested, if appropriate, and 
released. Procedures should be available to prevent discharging incoming materials 
wrongly into the existing stock. 
7.22 If bulk deliveries are made in non-dedicated tankers, there should be assurance 
of no cross-contamination from the tanker. Means of providing this assurance could 
include one or more of the following: 
-certificate of cleaning 

-testing for trace impurities 

-audit of the supplier. 

7.23 Large storage containers, and their attendant manifolds, filling and discharge 
lines should be appropriately identified. 
7.24 Each container or grouping of containers (batches) of materials should be 
assigned and identified with a distinctive code, batch, or receipt number. This number 
should be used in recording the disposition of each batch. A system should be in place 
to identify the status of each batch. 
7.3 Sampling and Testing of Incoming Production Materials 
7.30 At least one test to verify the identity of each batch of material should be 
conducted, with the exception of the materials described below in 7.32. A supplier's 
Certificate of Analysis can be used in place of performing other tests, provided that 
the manufacturer has a system in place to evaluate suppliers. 

7.31 Supplier approval should include an evaluation that provides adequate 
evidence (e.g., past quality history) that the manufacturer can consistently provide 
material meeting specifications. Full analyses should be conducted on at least three 
batches before reducing in-house testing. However, as a minimum, a full analysis 
should be performed at appropriate intervals and compared with the Certificates of 
Analysis. Reliability of Certificates of Analysis should be checked at regular 
intervals. 
7.32 Processing aids, hazardous or highly toxic raw materials, other special 
materials, or materials transferred to another unit within the company’s control do not 
need to be tested if the manufacturer’s Certificate of Analysis is obtained, showing 
that these raw materials conform to established specifications. Visual examination of 
containers, labels, and recording of batch numbers should help in establishing the 
identity of these materials. The lack of on-site testing for these materials should be 
justified and documented. 
7.33 Samples should be representative of the batch of material from which they are 
taken. 
Sampling methods should specify the number of containers to be sampled, which part 
of the container to sample, and the amount of material to be taken from each 
container. The number of containers to sample and the sample size should be based 
upon a sampling plan that takes into consideration the criticality of the material, 
material variability, past quality history of the supplier, and the quantity needed for 
analysis. 
7.34 Sampling should be conducted at defined locations and by procedures 
designed to prevent contamination of the material sampled and contamination of other 
materials. 
7.35 Containers from which samples are withdrawn should be opened carefully and 
subsequently reclosed. They should be marked to indicate that a sample has been 
taken. 
7.4 Storage 
7.40 Materials should be handled and stored in a manner to prevent degradation, 
contamination, and cross-contamination. 
7.41 Materials stored in fiber drums, bags, or boxes should be stored off the floor 
and, when appropriate, suitably spaced to permit cleaning and inspection. 
7.42 Materials should be stored under conditions and for a period that have no 
adverse affect on their quality, and should normally be controlled so that the oldest 
stock is used first. 
7.43 Certain materials in suitable containers can be stored outdoors, provided 
identifying labels remain legible and containers are appropriately cleaned before 
opening and use. 

7.44 Rejected materials should be identified and controlled under a quarantine 
system designed to prevent their unauthorised use in manufacturing. 
7.5 Re-evaluation 
7.50 Materials should be re-evaluated as appropriate to determine their suitability 
for use (e.g., after prolonged storage or exposure to heat or humidity). 
8 Production and In-Process Controls 

8.1 Production Operations 
8.10 Raw materials for intermediate and API manufacturing should be weighed or 
measured under appropriate conditions that do not affect their suitability for use. 
Weighing and measuring devices should be of suitable accuracy for the intended use. 
8.11 If a material is subdivided for later use in production operations, the container 
receiving the material should be suitable and should be so identified that the following 
information is available: 
-Material name and/or item code; 

-Receiving or control number; 

-Weight or measure of material in the new container; and 

-Re-evaluation or retest date if appropriate. 

8.12 Critical weighing, measuring, or subdividing operations should be witnessed 
or subjected to an equivalent control. Prior to use, production personnel should verify 
that the materials are those specified in the batch record for the intended intermediate 
or API. 
8.13 Other critical activities should be witnessed or subjected to an equivalent 
control. 
8.14 Actual yields should be compared with expected yields at designated steps in 
the production process. Expected yields with appropriate ranges should be established 
based on previous laboratory, pilot scale, or manufacturing data. Deviations in yield 
associated with critical process steps should be investigated to determine their impact 
or potential impact on the resulting quality of affected batches. 
8.15 Any deviation should be documented and explained. Any critical deviation 
should be investigated. 
8.16 The processing status of major units of equipment should be indicated either 
on the individual units of equipment or by appropriate documentation, computer 
control systems, or alternative means. 

8.17 Materials to be reprocessed or reworked should be appropriately controlled to 
prevent unauthorized use. 
8.2 Time Limits 
8.20 If time limits are specified in the master production instruction (see 6.41), 
these time limits should be met to ensure the quality of intermediates and APIs. 
Deviations should be documented and evaluated. Time limits may be inappropriate 
when processing to a target value (e.g., pH adjustment, hydrogenation, drying to 
predetermined specification) because completion of reactions or processing steps are 
determined by in-process sampling and testing. 
8.21 Intermediates held for further processing should be stored under appropriate 
conditions to ensure their suitability for use. 
8.3 In-process Sampling and Controls 
8.30 Written procedures should be established to monitor the progress and control 
the performance of processing steps that cause variability in the quality characteristics 
of intermediates and APIs. In-process controls and their acceptance criteria should be 
defined based on the information gained during the development stage or historical 
data. 
8.31 The acceptance criteria and type and extent of testing can depend on the nature 
of the intermediate or API being manufactured, the reaction or process step being 
conducted, and the degree to which the process introduces variability in the product’s 
quality. Less stringent in-process controls may be appropriate in early processing 
steps, whereas tighter controls may be appropriate for later processing steps (e.g., 
isolation and purification steps). 
8.32 Critical in-process controls (and critical process monitoring), including the 
control points and methods, should be stated in writing and approved by the quality 
unit(s). 
8.33 In-process controls can be performed by qualified production department 
personnel and the process adjusted without prior quality unit(s) approval if the 
adjustments are made within pre-established limits approved by the quality unit(s). 
All tests and results should be fully documented as part of the batch record. 
8.34 Written procedures should describe the sampling methods for in-process 
materials, intermediates, and APIs. Sampling plans and procedures should be based 
on scientifically sound sampling practices. 
8.35 In-process sampling should be conducted using procedures designed to 
prevent contamination of the sampled material and other intermediates or APIs. 
Procedures should be established to ensure the integrity of samples after collection. 

8.36 Out-of-specification (OOS) investigations are not normally needed for in-
process tests that are performed for the purpose of monitoring and/or adjusting the 
process. 
8.4 Blending Batches of Intermediates or APIs 
8.40 For the purpose of this document, blending is defined as the process of 
combining materials within the same specification to produce a homogeneous 
intermediate or API. In-process mixing of fractions from single batches (e.g., 
collecting several centrifuge loads from a single crystallization batch) or combining 
fractions from several batches for further processing is considered to be part of the 
production process and is not considered to be blending. 
8.41 Out-Of-Specification batches should not be blended with other batches for the 
purpose of meeting specifications. Each batch incorporated into the blend should have 
been manufactured using an established process and should have been individually 
tested and found to meet appropriate specifications prior to blending. 
8.42 Acceptable blending operations include but are not limited to: 
-Blending of small batches to increase batch size 

-Blending of tailings (i.e., relatively small quantities of isolated material) from 
batches of the same intermediate orAPItoforma single batch. 

8.43 Blending processes should be adequately controlled and documented and the 
blended batch should be tested for conformance to established specifications where 
appropriate. 
8.44 The batch record of the blending process should allow traceability back to the 
individual batches that make up the blend. 
8.45 Where physical attributes of the API are critical (e.g., APIs intended for use in 
solid oral dosage forms or suspensions), blending operations should be validated to 
show homogeneity of the combined batch. Validation should include testing of critical 
attributes (e.g., particle size distribution, bulk density, and tap density) that may be 
affected by the blending process. 
8.46 If the blending could adversely affect stability, stability testing of the final 
blended batches should be performed. 
8.47 The expiry or retest date of the blended batch should be based on the 
manufacturing date of the oldest tailings or batch in the blend. 
8.5 Contamination Control 
8.50 Residual materials can be carried over into successive batches of the same 
intermediate or API if there is adequate control. Examples include residue adhering to 
the wall of a micronizer, residual layer of damp crystals remaining in a centrifuge 

bowl after discharge, and incomplete discharge of fluids or crystals from a processing 
vessel upon transfer of the material to the next step in the process. Such carryover 
should not result in the carryover of degradants or microbial contamination that may 
adversely alter the established API impurity profile. 

8.51 Production operations should be conducted in a manner that will prevent 
contamination of intermediates or APIs by other materials. 
8.52 Precautions to avoid contamination should be taken when APIs are handled after 
purification. 
9 Packaging and Identification Labelling of APIs and Intermediates 

9.1 General 
9.10 There should be written procedures describing the receipt, identification, 
quarantine, sampling, examination and/or testing and release, and handling of 
packaging and labelling materials. 
9.11 Packaging and labelling materials should conform to established 
specifications. Those that do not comply with such specifications should be rejected 
to prevent their use in operations for which they are unsuitable. 
9.12 Records should be maintained for each shipment of labels and packaging 
materials showing receipt, examination, or testing, and whether accepted or rejected. 
9.2 Packaging Materials 
9.20 Containers should provide adequate protection against deterioration or 
contamination of the intermediate or API that may occur during transportation and 
recommended storage. 
9.21 Containers should be clean and, where indicated by the nature of the 
intermediate or API, sanitized to ensure that they are suitable for their intended use. 
These containers should not be reactive, additive, or absorptive so as to alter the 
quality of the intermediate or API beyond the specified limits. 
9.22 If containers are re-used, they should be cleaned in accordance with 
documented procedures and all previous labels should be removed or defaced. 
9.3 Label Issuance and Control 
9.30 Access to the label storage areas should be limited to authorised personnel. 
9.31 Procedures should be used to reconcile the quantities of labels issued, used, 
and returned and to evaluate discrepancies found between the number of containers 

labelled and the number of labels issued. Such discrepancies should be investigated, 
and the investigation should be approved by the quality unit(s). 

9.32 All excess labels bearing batch numbers or other batch-related printing should 
be destroyed. Returned labels should be maintained and stored in a manner that 
prevents mix-ups and provides proper identification. 
9.33 Obsolete and out-dated labels should be destroyed. 
9.34 Printing devices used to print labels for packaging operations should be 
controlled to ensure that all imprinting conforms to the print specified in the batch 
production record. 
9.35 Printed labels issued for a batch should be carefully examined for proper 
identity and conformity to specifications in the master production record. The results 
of this examination should be documented. 
9.36 A printed label representative of those used should be included in the batch 
production record. 
9.4 Packaging and Labelling Operations 
9.40 There should be documented procedures designed to ensure that correct 
packaging materials and labels are used. 
9.41 Labelling operations should be designed to prevent mix-ups. There should be 
physical or spatial separation from operations involving other intermediates or APIs. 
9.42 Labels used on containers of intermediates or APIs should indicate the name 
or identifying code, the batch number of the product, and storage conditions, when 
such information is critical to assure the quality of intermediate or API. 
9.43 If the intermediate or API is intended to be transferred outside the control of 
the manufacturer’s material management system, the name and address of the 
manufacturer, quantity of contents, and special transport conditions and any special 
legal requirements should also be included on the label. For intermediates or APIs 
with an expiry date, the expiry date should be indicated on the label and Certificate of 
Analysis. For intermediates or APIs with a retest date, the retest date should be 
indicated on the label and/or Certificate of Analysis. 
9.44 Packaging and labelling facilities should be inspected immediately before use 
to ensure that all materials not needed for the next packaging operation have been 
removed. This examination should be documented in the batch production records, 
the facility log, or other documentation system. 
9.45 Packaged and labelled intermediates or APIs should be examined to ensure 
that containers and packages in the batch have the correct label. This examination 
should be part of the packaging operation. Results of these examinations should be 
recorded in the batch production or control records. 

9.46 Intermediate or API containers that are transported outside of the 
manufacturer's control should be sealed in a manner such that, if the seal is breached 
or missing, the recipient will be alerted to the possibility that the contents may have 
been altered. 
10 Storage and Distribution 

10.1 Warehousing Procedures 
10.10 Facilities should be available for the storage of all materials under appropriate 
conditions (e.g. controlled temperature and humidity when necessary). Records 
should be maintained of these conditions if they are critical for the maintenance of 
material characteristics. 
10.11 Unless there is an alternative system to prevent the unintentional or 
unauthorised use of quarantined, rejected, returned, or recalled materials, separate 
storage areas should be assigned for their temporary storage until the decision as to 
their future use has been taken. 
10.2 Distribution Procedures 
10.20 APIs and intermediates should only be released for distribution to third parties 
after they have been released by the quality unit(s). APIs and intermediates can be 
transferred under quarantine to another unit under the company’s control when 
authorized by the quality unit(s) and if appropriate controls and documentation are in 
place. 
10.21 APIs and intermediates should be transported in a manner that does not 
adversely affect their quality. 
10.22 Special transport or storage conditions for an API or intermediate should be 
stated on the label. 
10.23 The manufacturer should ensure that the contract acceptor (contractor) for 
transportation of the API or intermediate knows and follows the appropriate transport 
and storage conditions. 
10.24 A system should be in place by which the distribution of each batch of 
intermediate and/or API can be readily determined to permit its recall. 
11 Laboratory Controls 

11.1 General Controls 
11.10 The independent quality unit(s) should have at its disposal adequate laboratory 
facilities. 

11.11 There should be documented procedures describing sampling, testing, 
approval or rejection of materials, and recording and storage of laboratory data. 
Laboratory records should be maintained in accordance with Section 6.6. 
11.12 All specifications, sampling plans, and test procedures should be scientifically 
sound and appropriate to ensure that raw materials, intermediates, APIs, and labels 
and packaging materials conform to established standards of quality and/or purity. 
Specifications and test procedures should be consistent with those included in the 
registration/filing. There can be specifications in addition to those in the 
registration/filing. Specifications, sampling plans, and test procedures, including 
changes to them, should be drafted by the appropriate organizational unit and 
reviewed and approved by the quality unit(s). 
11.13 Appropriate specifications should be established for APIs in accordance with 
accepted standards and consistent with the manufacturing process. The specifications 
should include a control of the impurities (e.g. organic impurities, inorganic 
impurities, and residual solvents). If the API has a specification for microbiological 
purity, appropriate action limits for total microbial counts and objectionable 
organisms should be established and met. If the API has a specification for 
endotoxins, appropriate action limits should be established and met. 
11.14 Laboratory controls should be followed and documented at the time of 
performance. Any departures from the above described procedures should be 
documented and explained. 
11.15 Any out-of-specification result obtained should be investigated and 
documented according to a procedure. This procedure should require analysis of the 
data, assessment of whether a significant problem exists, allocation of the tasks for 
corrective actions, and conclusions. Any re-sampling and/or retesting after OOS 
results should be performed according to a documented procedure. 
11.16 Reagents and standard solutions should be prepared and labelled following 
written procedures. “Use by” dates should be applied as appropriate for analytical 
reagents or standard solutions. 
11.17 Primary reference standards should be obtained as appropriate for the 
manufacture of APIs. The source of each primary reference standard should be 
documented. Records should be maintained of each primary reference standard’s 
storage and use in accordance with the supplier’s recommendations. Primary 
reference standards obtained from an officially recognised source are normally used 
without testing if stored under conditions consistent with the supplier’s 
recommendations. 
11.18 Where a primary reference standard is not available from an officially 
recognized source, an “in-house primary standard” should be established. Appropriate 
testing should be performed to establish fully the identity and purity of the primary 
reference standard. Appropriate documentation of this testing should be maintained. 
11.19 Secondary reference standards should be appropriately prepared, identified, 
tested, approved, and stored. The suitability of each batch of secondary reference 

standard should be determined prior to first use by comparing against a primary 
reference standard. Each batch of secondary reference standard should be periodically 
requalified in accordance with a written protocol. 

11.2 Testing of Intermediates and APIs 
11.20 For each batch of intermediate and API, appropriate laboratory tests should be 
conducted to determine conformance to specifications. 
11.21 An impurity profile describing the identified and unidentified impurities 
present in a typical batch produced by a specific controlled production process should 
normally be established for each API. The impurity profile should include the identity 
or some qualitative analytical designation (e.g. retention time), the range of each 
impurity observed, and classification of each identified impurity (e.g. inorganic, 
organic, solvent). The impurity profile is normally dependent upon the production 
process and origin of the API. Impurity profiles are normally not necessary for APIs 
from herbal or animal tissue origin. Biotechnology considerations are covered in ICH 
Guideline Q6B. 
11.22 The impurity profile should be compared at appropriate intervals against the 
impurity profile in the regulatory submission or compared against historical data in 
order to detect changes to the API resulting from modifications in raw materials, 
equipment operating parameters, or the production process. 
11.23 Appropriate microbiological tests should be conducted on each batch of 
intermediate and API where microbial quality is specified. 
11.3 Validation of Analytical Procedures - see Section 12. 
11.4 Certificates of Analysis 
11.40 Authentic Certificates of Analysis should be issued for each batch of 
intermediate or API on request. 
11.41 Information on the name of the intermediate or API including where 
appropriate its grade, the batch number, and the date of release should be provided on 
the Certificate of Analysis. For intermediates or APIs with an expiry date, the expiry 
date should be provided on the label and Certificate of Analysis. For intermediates or 
APIs with a retest date, the retest date should be indicated on the label and/or 
Certificate of Analysis. 
11.42 The Certificate should list each test performed in accordance with compendial 
or customer requirements, including the acceptance limits, and the numerical results 
obtained (if test results are numerical). 
11.43 Certificates should be dated and signed by authorised personnel of the quality 
unit(s) and should show the name, address and telephone number of the original 
manufacturer. Where the analysis has been carried out by a repacker or reprocessor, 

the Certificate of Analysis should show the name, address and telephone number of 
the repacker/ reprocessor and a reference to the name of the original manufacturer. 

11.44 If new Certificates are issued by or on behalf of repackers/ reprocessors, 
agents or brokers, these Certificates should show the name, address and telephone 
number of the laboratory that performed the analysis. They should also contain a 
reference to the name and address of the original manufacturer and to the original 
batch Certificate, a copy of which should be attached. 
11.5 Stability Monitoring of APIs 
11.50 A documented, on-going testing program should be designed to monitor the 
stability characteristics of APIs, and the results should be used to confirm appropriate 
storage conditions and retest or expiry dates. 
11.51 The test procedures used in stability testing should be validated and be 
stability indicating. 
11.52 Stability samples should be stored in containers that simulate the market 
container. For example, if the API is marketed in bags within fiber drums, stability 
samples can be packaged in bags of the same material and in smaller-scale drums of 
similar or identical material composition to the market drums. 
11.53 Normally the first three commercial production batches should be placed on 
the stability monitoring program to confirm the retest or expiry date. However, where 
data from previous studies show that the API is expected to remain stable for at least 
two years, fewer than three batches can be used. 
11.54 Thereafter, at least one batch per year of API manufactured (unless none is 
produced that year) should be added to the stability monitoring program and tested at 
least annually to confirm the stability. 
11.55 For APIs with short shelf-lives, testing should be done more frequently. For 
example, for those biotechnological/biologic and other APIs with shelf-lives of one 
year or less, stability samples should be obtained and should be tested monthly for the 
first three months, and at three month intervals after that. When data exist that 
confirm that the stability of the API is not compromised, elimination of specific test 
intervals (e.g. 9 month testing) can be considered. 
11.56 Where appropriate, the stability storage conditions should be consistent with 
the ICH guidelines on stability. 
11.6 Expiry and Retest Dating 
11.60 When an intermediate is intended to be transferred outside the control of the 
manufacturer’s material management system and an expiry or retest date is assigned, 
supporting stability information should be available (e.g. published data, test results). 

11.61 An API expiry or retest date should be based on an evaluation of data derived 
from stability studies. Common practice is to use a retest date, not an expiration date. 
11.62 Preliminary API expiry or retest dates can be based on pilot scale batches if 
(1) the pilot batches employ a method of manufacture and procedure that simulates 
the final process to be used on a commercial manufacturing scale; and (2) the quality 
of the API represents the material to be made on a commercial scale. 
11.63 A representative sample should be taken for the purpose of performing a 
retest. 
11.7 Reserve/Retention Samples 
11.70 The packaging and holding of reserve samples is for the purpose of potential 
future evaluation of the quality of batches of API and not for future stability testing 
purposes. 
11.71 Appropriately identified reserve samples of each API batch should be retained 
for one year after the expiry date of the batch assigned by the manufacturer, or for 
three years after distribution of the batch, whichever is the longer. For APIs with 
retest dates, similar reserve samples should be retained for three years after the batch 
is completely distributed by the manufacturer. 
11.72 The reserve sample should be stored in the same packaging system in which 
the API is stored or in one that is equivalent to or more protective than the marketed 
packaging system. Sufficient quantities should be retained to conduct at least two full 
compendial analyses or, when there is no pharmacopoeial monograph, two full 
specification analyses. 
12 Validation 

12.1 Validation Policy 
12.10 The company's overall policy, intentions, and approach to validation, 
including the validation of production processes, cleaning procedures, analytical 
methods, in-process control test procedures, computerized systems, and persons 
responsible for design, review, approval and documentation of each validation phase, 
should be documented. 
12.11 The critical parameters/attributes should normally be identified during the 
development stage or from historical data, and the ranges necessary for the 
reproducible operation should be defined. This should include: 
-Defining the API in terms of its critical product attributes; 

-Identifying process parameters that could affect the critical quality attributes 
of the API; 


-Determining the range for each critical process parameter expected to be used 
during routine manufacturing and process control. 

12.12 Validation should extend to those operations determined to be critical to the 
quality and purity of the API. 
12.2 Validation Documentation 
12.20 A written validation protocol should be established that specifies how 
validation of a particular process will be conducted. The protocol should be reviewed 
and approved by the quality unit(s) and other designated units. 
12.21 The validation protocol should specify critical process steps and acceptance 
criteria as well as the type of validation to be conducted (e.g. retrospective, 
prospective, concurrent) and the number of process runs. 
12.22 A validation report that cross-references the validation protocol should be 
prepared, summarising the results obtained, commenting on any deviations observed, 
and drawing the appropriate conclusions, including recommending changes to correct 
deficiencies. 
12.23 Any variations from the validation protocol should be documented with 
appropriate justification. 
12.3 Qualification 
12.30 Before starting process validation activities, appropriate qualification of 
critical equipment and ancillary systems should be completed. Qualification is usually 
carried out by conducting the following activities, individually or combined: 
-Design Qualification (DQ): documented verification that the proposed design 
of the facilities, equipment, or systems is suitable for the intended purpose. 

-Installation Qualification (IQ): documented verification that the equipment or 
systems, as installed or modified, comply with the approved design, the 
manufacturer’s recommendations and/or user requirements. 

-Operational Qualification (OQ): documented verification that the equipment 
or systems, as installed or modified, perform as intended throughout the 
anticipated operating ranges. 

-Performance Qualification (PQ): documented verification that the equipment 
and ancillary systems, as connected together, can perform effectively and 
reproducibly based on the approved process method and specifications. 


12.4 Approaches to Process Validation 
12.40 Process Validation (PV) is the documented evidence that the process, operated 
within established parameters, can perform effectively and reproducibly to produce an 
intermediate or API meeting its predetermined specifications and quality attributes. 
12.41 There are three approaches to validation. Prospective validation is the 
preferred approach, but there are exceptions where the other approaches can be used. 
These approaches and their applicability are listed below. 
12.42 Prospective validation should normally be performed for all API processes as 
defined in 12.12. Prospective validation performed on an API process should be 
completed before the commercial distribution of the final drug product manufactured 
from that API. 
12.43 Concurrent validation can be conducted when data from replicate production 
runs are unavailable because only a limited number of API batches have been 
produced, API batches are produced infrequently, or API batches are produced by a 
validated process that has been modified. Prior to the completion of concurrent 
validation, batches can be released and used in final drug product for commercial 
distribution based on thorough monitoring and testing of the API batches. 
12.44 An exception can be made for retrospective validation for well established 
processes that have been used without significant changes to API quality due to 
changes in raw materials, equipment, systems, facilities, or the production process. 
This validation approach may be used where: 
(1) Critical quality attributes and critical process parameters have been identified; 
(2) Appropriate in-process acceptance criteria and controls have been established; 
(3) There have not been significant process/product failures attributable to causes 
other than operator error or equipment failures unrelated to equipment suitability; and 
(4) Impurity profiles have been established for the existing API. 
12.45 Batches selected for retrospective validation should be representative of all 
batches made during the review period, including any batches that failed to meet 
specifications, and should be sufficient in number to demonstrate process consistency. 
Retained samples can be tested to obtain data to retrospectively validate the process. 
12.5 Process Validation Program 
12.50 The number of process runs for validation should depend on the complexity of 
the process or the magnitude of the process change being considered. For prospective 
and concurrent validation, three consecutive successful production batches should be 
used as a guide, but there may be situations where additional process runs are 
warranted to prove consistency of the process (e.g., complex API processes or API 
processes with prolonged completion times). For retrospective validation, generally 

data from ten to thirty consecutive batches should be examined to assess process 
consistency, but fewer batches can be examined if justified. 

12.51 Critical process parameters should be controlled and monitored during process 
validation studies. Process parameters unrelated to quality, such as variables 
controlled to minimize energy consumption or equipment use, need not be included in 
the process validation. 
12.52 Process validation should confirm that the impurity profile for each API is 
within the limits specified. The impurity profile should be comparable to or better 
than historical data and, where applicable, the profile determined during process 
development or for batches used for pivotal clinical and toxicological studies. 
12.6 Periodic Review of Validated Systems 
12.60 Systems and processes should be periodically evaluated to verify that they are 
still operating in a valid manner. Where no significant changes have been made to the 
system or process, and a quality review confirms that the system or process is 
consistently producing material meeting its specifications, there is normally no need 
for revalidation. 
12.7 Cleaning Validation 
12.70 Cleaning procedures should normally be validated. In general, cleaning 
validation should be directed to situations or process steps where contamination or 
carryover of materials poses the greatest risk to API quality. For example, in early 
production it may be unnecessary to validate equipment cleaning procedures where 
residues are removed by subsequent purification steps. 
12.71 Validation of cleaning procedures should reflect actual equipment usage 
patterns. If various APIs or intermediates are manufactured in the same equipment 
and the equipment is cleaned by the same process, a representative intermediate or 
API can be selected for cleaning validation. This selection should be based on the 
solubility and difficulty of cleaning and the calculation of residue limits based on 
potency, toxicity, and stability. 
12.72 The cleaning validation protocol should describe the equipment to be cleaned, 
procedures, materials, acceptable cleaning levels, parameters to be monitored and 
controlled, and analytical methods. The protocol should also indicate the type of 
samples to be obtained and how they are collected and labelled. 
12.73 Sampling should include swabbing, rinsing, or alternative methods (e.g., direct 
extraction), as appropriate, to detect both insoluble and soluble residues. The 
sampling methods used should be capable of quantitatively measuring levels of 
residues remaining on the equipment surfaces after cleaning. Swab sampling may be 
impractical when product contact surfaces are not easily accessible due to equipment 
design and/or process limitations (e.g., inner surfaces of hoses, transfer pipes, reactor 
tanks with small ports or handling toxic materials, and small intricate equipment such 
as micronizers and microfluidizers). 

12.74 Validated analytical methods having sensitivity to detect residues or 
contaminants should be used. The detection limit for each analytical method should 
be sufficiently sensitive to detect the established acceptable level of the residue or 
contaminant. The method’s attainable recovery level should be established. Residue 
limits should be practical, achievable, verifiable and based on the most deleterious 
residue. Limits can be established based on the minimum known pharmacological, 
toxicological, or physiological activity of the API or its most deleterious component. 
12.75 Equipment cleaning/sanitization studies should address microbiological and 
endotoxin contamination for those processes where there is a need to reduce total 
microbiological count or endotoxins in the API, or other processes where such 
contamination could be of concern (e.g., non-sterile APIs used to manufacture sterile 
products). 
12.76 Cleaning procedures should be monitored at appropriate intervals after 
validation to ensure that these procedures are effective when used during routine 
production. Equipment cleanliness can be monitored by analytical testing and visual 
examination, where feasible. Visual inspection can allow detection of gross 
contamination concentrated in small areas that could otherwise go undetected by 
sampling and/or analysis. 
12.8 Validation of Analytical Methods 
12.80 Analytical methods should be validated unless the method employed is 
included in the relevant pharmacopoeia or other recognised standard reference. The 
suitability of all testing methods used should nonetheless be verified under actual 
conditions of use and documented. 
12.81 Methods should be validated to include consideration of characteristics 
included within the ICH guidelines on validation of analytical methods. The degree of 
analytical validation performed should reflect the purpose of the analysis and the 
stage of the API production process. 
12.82 Appropriate qualification of analytical equipment should be considered before 
starting validation of analytical methods. 
12.83 Complete records should be maintained of any modification of a validated 
analytical method. Such records should include the reason for the modification and 
appropriate data to verify that the modification produces results that are as accurate 
and reliable as the established method. 
13 Change Control 

13.10 A formal change control system should be established to evaluate all changes 
that may affect the production and control of the intermediate or API. 

13.11 Written procedures should provide for the identification, documentation, 
appropriate review, and approval of changes in raw materials, specifications, 
analytical methods, facilities, support systems, equipment (including computer 
hardware), processing steps, labelling and packaging materials, and computer 
software. 
13.12 Any proposals for GMP relevant changes should be drafted, reviewed, and 
approved by the appropriate organisational units, and reviewed and approved by the 
quality unit(s). 
13.13 The potential impact of the proposed change on the quality of the intermediate 
or API should be evaluated. A classification procedure may help in determining the 
level of testing, validation, and documentation needed to justify changes to a validated 
process. Changes can be classified (e.g. as minor or major) depending on the nature 
and extent of the changes, and the effects these changes may impart on the process. 
Scientific judgement should determine what additional testing and validation studies 
are appropriate to justify a change in a validated process. 
13.14 When implementing approved changes, measures should be taken to ensure 
that all documents affected by the changes are revised. 
13.15 After the change has been implemented, there should be an evaluation of the 
first batches produced or tested under the change. 
13.16 The potential for critical changes to affect established retest or expiry dates 
should be evaluated. If necessary, samples of the intermediate or API produced by the 
modified process can be placed on an accelerated stability program and/or can be 
added to the stability monitoring program. 
13.17 Current dosage form manufacturers should be notified of changes from 
established production and process control procedures that can impact the quality of 
the API. 
14 Rejection and Re-Use of Materials 

14.1 Rejection 
14.10 Intermediates and APIs failing to meet established specifications should be 
identified as such and quarantined. These intermediates or APIs can be reprocessed or 
reworked as described below. The final disposition of rejected materials should be 
recorded. 
14.2 Reprocessing 
14.20 Introducing an intermediate or API, including one that does not conform to 
standards or specifications, back into the process and reprocessing by repeating a 
crystallization step or other appropriate chemical or physical manipulation steps (e.g., 
distillation, filtration, chromatography, milling) that are part of the established 
manufacturing process is generally considered acceptable. However, if such 

reprocessing is used for a majority of batches, such reprocessing should be included 
as part of the standard manufacturing process. 

14.21 Continuation of a process step after an in-process control test has shown that 
the step is incomplete is considered to be part of the normal process. This is not 
considered to be reprocessing. 
14.22 Introducing unreacted material back into a process and repeating a chemical 
reaction is considered to be reprocessing unless it is part of the established process. 
Such reprocessing should be preceded by careful evaluation to ensure that the quality 
of the intermediate or API is not adversely impacted due to the potential formation of 
by-products and over-reacted materials. 
14.3 Reworking 
14.30 Before a decision is taken to rework batches that do not conform to established 
standards or specifications, an investigation into the reason for non-conformance 
should be performed. 
14.31 Batches that have been reworked should be subjected to appropriate 
evaluation, testing, stability testing if warranted, and documentation to show that the 
reworked product is of equivalent quality to that produced by the original process. 
Concurrent validation is often the appropriate validation approach for rework 
procedures. This allows a protocol to define the rework procedure, how it will be 
carried out, and the expected results. If there is only one batch to be reworked, then a 
report can be written and the batch released once it is found to be acceptable. 
14.32 Procedures should provide for comparing the impurity profile of each 
reworked batch against batches manufactured by the established process. Where 
routine analytical methods are inadequate to characterize the reworked batch, 
additional methods should be used. 
14.4 Recovery of Materials and Solvents 
14.40 Recovery (e.g. from mother liquor or filtrates) of reactants, intermediates, or 
the API is considered acceptable, provided that approved procedures exist for the 
recovery and the recovered materials meet specifications suitable for their intended 
use. 
14.41 Solvents can be recovered and reused in the same processes or in different 
processes, provided that the recovery procedures are controlled and monitored to 
ensure that solvents meet appropriate standards before reuse or co-mingling with 
other approved materials. 
14.42 Fresh and recovered solvents and reagents can be combined if adequate testing 
has shown their suitability for all manufacturing processes in which they may be used. 

14.43 The use of recovered solvents, mother liquors, and other recovered materials 
should be adequately documented. 
14.5 Returns 
14.50 Returned intermediates or APIs should be identified as such and quarantined. 
14.51 If the conditions under which returned intermediates or APIs have been stored 
or shipped before or during their return or the condition of their containers casts doubt 
on their quality, the returned intermediates or APIs should be reprocessed, reworked, 
or destroyed, as appropriate. 
14.52 Records of returned intermediates or APIs should be maintained. For each 
return, documentation should include: 
-Name and address of the consignee 

-Intermediate or API, batch number, and quantity returned 

-Reason for return 

-Use or disposal of the returned intermediate or API 

15 Complaints and Recalls 

15.10 All quality related complaints, whether received orally or in writing, should be 
recorded and investigated according to a written procedure. 
15.11 Complaint records should include: 
-Name and address of complainant; 

-Name (and, where appropriate, title) and phone number of person submitting 

the complaint; 

-Complaint nature (including name and batch number of the API); 

-Date complaint is received; 

-Action initially taken (including dates and identity of person taking the 

action); 

-Any follow-up action taken; 

-Response provided to the originator of complaint (including date response 

sent); and 

-Final decision on intermediate or API batch or lot. 

15.12 Records of complaints should be retained in order to evaluate trends, product-
related frequencies, and severity with a view to taking additional, and if appropriate, 
immediate corrective action. 
15.13 There should be a written procedure that defines the circumstances under 
which a recall of an intermediate or API should be considered. 

15.14 The recall procedure should designate who should be involved in evaluating 
the information, how a recall should be initiated, who should be informed about the 
recall, and how the recalled material should be treated. 
15.15 In the event of a serious or potentially life-threatening situation, local, 
national, and/or international authorities should be informed and their advice sought. 
16 Contract Manufacturers (including Laboratories) 

16.10 All contract manufacturers (including laboratories) should comply with the 
GMP defined in this Guide. Special consideration should be given to the prevention of 
cross-contamination and to maintaining traceability. 
16.11 Contract manufacturers (including laboratories) should be evaluated by the 
contract giver to ensure GMP compliance of the specific operations occurring at the 
contract sites. 
16.12 There should be a written and approved contract or formal agreement between 
the contract giver and the contract acceptor that defines in detail the GMP 
responsibilities, including the quality measures, of each party. 
16.13 The contract should permit the contract giver to audit the contract acceptor's 
facilities for compliance with GMP. 
16.14 Where subcontracting is allowed, the contract acceptor should not pass to a 
third party any of the work entrusted to him under the contract without the contract 
giver's prior evaluation and approval of the arrangements. 
16.15 Manufacturing and laboratory records should be kept at the site where the 
activity occurs and be readily available. 
16.16 Changes in the process, equipment, test methods, specifications, or other 
contractual requirements should not be made unless the contract giver is informed and 
approves the changes. 
17 Agents, Brokers, Traders, Distributors, Repackers, and Relabellers 

17.1 Applicability 
17.10 This section applies to any party other than the original manufacturer who may 
trade and/or take possession, repack, relabel, manipulate, distribute or store an API or 
intermediate. 
17.11 All agents, brokers, traders, distributors, repackers, and relabellers should 
comply with GMP as defined in this Guide. 

17.2 Traceability of Distributed APIs and Intermediates 
17.20 Agents, brokers, traders, distributors, repackers, or relabellers should maintain 
complete traceability of APIs and intermediates that they distribute. Documents that 
should be retained and available include: 
-Identity of original manufacturer 

-Address of original manufacturer 

-Purchase orders 

-Bills of lading (transportation documentation) 

-Receipt documents 

-Name or designation of API or intermediate 

-Manufacturer’s batch number 

-Transportation and distribution records 

-All authentic Certificates of Analysis, including those of the original 
manufacturer 

-Retest or expiry date 

17.3 Quality Management 
17.30 Agents, brokers, traders, distributors, repackers, or relabellers should establish, 
document and implement an effective system of managing quality, as specified in 
Section 2. 
17.4 Repackaging, Relabelling and Holding of APIs and Intermediates 
17.40 Repackaging, relabelling and holding of APIs and intermediates should be 
performed under appropriate GMP controls, as stipulated in this Guide, to avoid mix-
ups and loss of API or intermediate identity or purity. 
17.41 Repackaging should be conducted under appropriate environmental conditions 
to avoid contamination and cross-contamination. 
17.5 Stability 
17.50 Stability studies to justify assigned expiration or retest dates should be 
conducted if the API or intermediate is repackaged in a different type of container 
than that used by the API or intermediate manufacturer. 

17.6 Transfer of Information 
17.60 Agents, brokers, distributors, repackers, or relabellers should transfer all 
quality or regulatory information received from an API or intermediate manufacturer 
to the customer, and from the customer to the API or intermediate manufacturer. 
17.61 The agent, broker, trader, distributor, repacker, or relabeller who supplies the 
API or intermediate to the customer should provide the name of the original API or 
intermediate manufacturer and the batch number(s) supplied. 
17.62 The agent should also provide the identity of the original API or intermediate 
manufacturer to regulatory authorities upon request. The original manufacturer can 
respond to the regulatory authority directly or through its authorized agents, 
depending on the legal relationship between the authorized agents and the original 
API or intermediate manufacturer. (In this context "authorized" refers to authorized 
by the manufacturer.) 
17.63 The specific guidance for Certificates of Analysis included in Section 11.4 
should be met. 
17.7 Handling of Complaints and Recalls 
17.70 Agents, brokers, traders, distributors, repackers, or relabellers should maintain 
records of complaints and recalls, as specified in Section 15, for all complaints and 
recalls that come to their attention. 
17.71 If the situation warrants, the agents, brokers, traders, distributors, repackers, or 
relabellers should review the complaint with the original API or intermediate 
manufacturer in order to determine whether any further action, either with other 
customers who may have received this API or intermediate or with the regulatory 
authority, or both, should be initiated. The investigation into the cause for the 
complaint or recall should be conducted and documented by the appropriate party. 
17.72 Where a complaint is referred to the original API or intermediate 
manufacturer, the record maintained by the agents, brokers, traders, distributors, 
repackers, or relabellers should include any response received from the original API 
or intermediate manufacturer (including date and information provided). 
17.8 Handling of Returns 
17.80 Returns should be handled as specified in Section 14.52. The agents, brokers, 
traders, distributors, repackers, or relabellers should maintain documentation of 
returned APIs and intermediates. 

18. Specific Guidance for APIs Manufactured by Cell Culture/Fermentation 
18.1 General 
18.10 Section 18 is intended to address specific controls for APIs or intermediates 
manufactured by cell culture or fermentation using natural or recombinant organisms 
and that have not been covered adequately in the previous sections. It is not intended 
to be a stand-alone Section. In general, the GMP principles in the other sections of 
this document apply. Note that the principles of fermentation for “classical” processes 
for production of small molecules and for processes using recombinant and non-
recombinant organisms for production of proteins and/or polypeptides are the same, 
although the degree of control will differ. Where practical, this section will address 
these differences. In general, the degree of control for biotechnological processes used 
to produce proteins and polypeptides is greater than that for classical fermentation 
processes. 
18.11 The term “biotechnological process” (biotech) refers to the use of cells or 
organisms that have been generated or modified by recombinant DNA, hybridoma or 
other technology to produce APIs. The APIs produced by biotechnological processes 
normally consist of high molecular weight substances, such as proteins and 
polypeptides, for which specific guidance is given in this Section. Certain APIs of low 
molecular weight, such as antibiotics, amino acids, vitamins, and carbohydrates, can 
also be produced by recombinant DNA technology.The level of control for these 
types of APIs is similar to that employed for classical fermentation. 
18.12 The term “classical fermentation” refers to processes that use microorganisms 
existing in nature and/or modified by conventional methods (e.g. irradiation or 
chemical mutagenesis) to produce APIs. APIs produced by “classical fermentation” 
are normally low molecular weight products such as antibiotics, amino acids, 
vitamins, and carbohydrates. 
18.13 Production of APIs or intermediates from cell culture or fermentation involves 
biological processes such as cultivation of cells or extraction and purification of 
material from living organisms. Note that there may be additional process steps, such 
as physicochemical modification, that are part of the manufacturing process. The raw 
materials used (media, buffer components) may provide the potential for growth of 
microbiological contaminants. 
Depending on the source, method of preparation, and the intended use of the API or 
intermediate, control of bioburden, viral contamination, and/or endotoxins during 
manufacturing and monitoring of the process at appropriate stages may be necessary. 
18.14 Appropriate controls should be established at all stages of manufacturing to 
assure intermediate and/or API quality. While this Guide starts at the cell 
culture/fermentation step, prior steps (e.g. cell banking) should be performed under 
appropriate process controls. This Guide covers cell culture/fermentation from the 
point at which a vial of the cell bank is retrieved for use in manufacturing. 
18.15 Appropriate equipment and environmental controls should be used to 
minimize the risk of contamination. The acceptance criteria for quality of the 

environment and the frequency of monitoring should depend on the step in production 
and the production conditions (open, closed, or contained systems). 

18.16 In general, process controls should take into account: 
-Maintenance of the Working Cell Bank (where appropriate); 

-Proper inoculation and expansion of the culture; 

-Control of the critical operating parameters during fermentation/cell culture; 

-Monitoring of the process for cell growth, viability (for most cell culture 
processes) and productivity where appropriate; 

-Harvest and purification procedures that remove cells, cellular debris and 
media components while protecting the intermediate or API from 
contamination (particularly of a microbiological nature) and from loss of 
quality; 

-Monitoring of bioburden and, where needed, endotoxin levels at appropriate 
stages of production; and 

-Viral safety concerns as described in ICH Guideline Q5A Quality of 
Biotechnological Products: Viral Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology 
Products Derived from Cell Lines of Human or Animal Origin. 

18.17 Where appropriate, the removal of media components, host cell proteins, other 
process-related impurities, product-related impurities and contaminants should be 
demonstrated. 
18.2 Cell Bank Maintenance and Record Keeping 
18.20 Access to cell banks should be limited to authorized personnel. 
18.21 Cell banks should be maintained under storage conditions designed to 
maintain viability and prevent contamination. 
18.22 Records of the use of the vials from the cell banks and storage conditions 
should be maintained. 
18.23 Where appropriate, cell banks should be periodically monitored to determine 
suitability for use. 
18.24 See ICH Guideline Q5D Quality of Biotechnological Products: Derivation 
and Characterization of Cell Substrates Used for Production of 
Biotechnological/Biological Products for a more complete discussion of cell banking. 
18.3 Cell Culture/Fermentation 
18.30 Where aseptic addition of cell substrates, media, buffers, and gases is needed, 
closed or contained systems should be used where possible. If the inoculation of the 

initial vessel or subsequent transfers or additions (media, buffers) are performed in 
open vessels, there should be controls and procedures in place to minimize the risk of 
contamination. 

18.31 Where the quality of the API can be affected by microbial contamination, 
manipulations using open vessels should be performed in a biosafety cabinet or 
similarly controlled environment. 
18.32 Personnel should be appropriately gowned and take special precautions 
handling the cultures. 
18.33 Critical operating parameters (for example temperature, pH, agitation rates, 
addition of gases, pressure) should be monitored to ensure consistency with the 
established process. Cell growth, viability (for most cell culture processes), and, 
where appropriate, productivity should also be monitored. Critical parameters will 
vary from one process to another, and for classical fermentation, certain parameters 
(cell viability, for example) may not need to be monitored. 
18.34 Cell culture equipment should be cleaned and sterilized after use. As 
appropriate, fermentation equipment should be cleaned, and sanitized or sterilized. 
18.35 Culture media should be sterilized before use when appropriate to protect the 
quality of the API. 
18.36 There should be appropriate procedures in place to detect contamination and 
determine the course of action to be taken. This should include procedures to 
determine the impact of the contamination on the product and those to decontaminate 
the equipment and return it to a condition to be used in subsequent batches. Foreign 
organisms observed during fermentation processes should be identified as appropriate 
and the effect of their presence on product quality should be assessed, if necessary. 
The results of such assessments should be taken into consideration in the disposition 
of the material produced. 
18.37 Records of contamination events should be maintained. 
18.38 Shared (multi-product) equipment may warrant additional testing after 
cleaning between product campaigns, as appropriate, to minimize the risk of cross-
contamination. 
18.4 Harvesting, Isolation and Purification 
18.40 Harvesting steps, either to remove cells or cellular components or to collect 
cellular components after disruption, should be performed in equipment and areas 
designed to minimize the risk of contamination. 
18.41 Harvest and purification procedures that remove or inactivate the producing 
organism, cellular debris and media components (while minimizing degradation, 
contamination, and loss of quality) should be adequate to ensure that the intermediate 
or API is recovered with consistent quality. 

18.42 All equipment should be properly cleaned and, as appropriate, sanitized after 
use. Multiple successive batching without cleaning can be used if intermediate or API 
quality is not compromised. 
18.43 If open systems are used, purification should be performed under 
environmental conditions appropriate for the preservation of product quality. 
18. 44 Additional controls, such as the use of dedicated chromatography resins or 
additional testing, may be appropriate if equipment is to be used for multiple 
products. 
18.5 Viral Removal/Inactivation steps 
18.50 See the ICH Guideline Q5A Quality of Biotechnological Products: Viral 
Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology Products Derived from Cell Lines of Human or 
Animal Origin for more specific information. 
18.51 Viral removal and viral inactivation steps are critical processing steps for 
some processes and should be performed within their validated parameters. 
18.52 Appropriate precautions should be taken to prevent potential viral 
contamination from pre-viral to post-viral removal/inactivation steps. Therefore, open 
processing should be performed in areas that are separate from other processing 
activities and have separate air handling units. 
18.53 The same equipment is not normally used for different purification steps. 
However, if the same equipment is to be used, the equipment should be appropriately 
cleaned and sanitized before reuse. Appropriate precautions should be taken to 
prevent potential virus carry-over (e.g. through equipment or environment) from 
previous steps. 
19 APIs for Use in Clinical Trials 

19.1 General 
19.10 Not all the controls in the previous sections of this Guide are appropriate for 
the manufacture of a new API for investigational use during its development. Section 
19 provides specific guidance unique to these circumstances. 
19.11 The controls used in the manufacture of APIs for use in clinical trials should 
be consistent with the stage of development of the drug product incorporating the 
API. Process and test procedures should be flexible to provide for changes as 
knowledge of the process increases and clinical testing of a drug product progresses 
from pre-clinical stages through clinical stages. Once drug development reaches the 
stage where the API is produced for use in drug products intended for clinical trials, 
manufacturers should ensure that APIs are manufactured in suitable facilities using 
appropriate production and control procedures to ensure the quality of the API. 

19.2 Quality 
19.20 Appropriate GMP concepts should be applied in the production of APIs for 
use in clinical trials with a suitable mechanism of approval of each batch. 
19.21 A quality unit(s) independent from production should be established for the 
approval or rejection of each batch of API for use in clinical trials. 
19.22 Some of the testing functions commonly performed by the quality unit(s) can 
be performed within other organizational units. 
19.23 Quality measures should include a system for testing of raw materials, 
packaging materials, intermediates, and APIs. 
19.24 Process and quality problems should be evaluated. 
19.25 Labelling for APIs intended for use in clinical trials should be appropriately 
controlled and should identify the material as being for investigational use. 
19.3 Equipment and Facilities 
19.30 During all phases of clinical development, including the use of small-scale 
facilities or laboratories to manufacture batches of APIs for use in clinical trials, 
procedures should be in place to ensure that equipment is calibrated, clean and 
suitable for its intended use. 
19.31 Procedures for the use of facilities should ensure that materials are handled in 
a manner that minimizes the risk of contamination and cross-contamination. 
19.4 Control of Raw Materials 
19.40 Raw materials used in production of APIs for use in clinical trials should be 
evaluated by testing, or received with a supplier’s analysis and subjected to identity 
testing. When a material is considered hazardous, a supplier's analysis should suffice. 
19.41 In some instances, the suitability of a raw material can be determined before 
use based on acceptability in small-scale reactions (i.e., use testing) rather than on 
analytical testing alone. 
19.5 Production 
19.50 The production of APIs for use in clinical trials should be documented in 
laboratory notebooks, batch records, or by other appropriate means. These documents 
should include information on the use of production materials, equipment, processing, 
and scientific observations. 

19.51 Expected yields can be more variable and less defined than the expected yields 
used in commercial processes. Investigations into yield variations are not expected. 
19.6 Validation 
19.60 Process validation for the production of APIs for use in clinical trials is 
normally inappropriate, where a single API batch is produced or where process 
changes during API development make batch replication difficult or inexact. The 
combination of controls, calibration, and, where appropriate, equipment qualification 
assures API quality during this development phase. 
19.61 Process validation should be conducted in accordance with Section 12 when 
batches are produced for commercial use, even when such batches are produced on a 
pilot or small scale. 
19.7 Changes 
19.70 Changes are expected during development, as knowledge is gained and the 
production is scaled up. Every change in the production, specifications, or test 
procedures should be adequately recorded. 
19.8 Laboratory Controls 
19.80 While analytical methods performed to evaluate a batch of API for clinical 
trials may not yet be validated, they should be scientifically sound. 
19.81 A system for retaining reserve samples of all batches should be in place. This 
system should ensure that a sufficient quantity of each reserve sample is retained for 
an appropriate length of time after approval, termination, or discontinuation of an 
application. 
19.82 Expiry and retest dating as defined in Section 11.6 applies to existing APIs 
used in clinical trials. For new APIs, Section 11.6 does not normally apply in early 
stages of clinical trials. 
19.9 Documentation 
19.90 A system should be in place to ensure that information gained during the 
development and the manufacture of APIs for use in clinical trials is documented and 
available. 
19.91 The development and implementation of the analytical methods used to 
support the release of a batch of API for use in clinical trials should be appropriately 
documented. 

19.92 A system for retaining production and control records and documents should 
be used. This system should ensure that records and documents are retained for an 
appropriate length of time after the approval, termination, or discontinuation of an 
application.
