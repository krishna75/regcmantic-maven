5.25 The purchase of starting materials is an important operation which should involve staff
who have a particular and thorough knowledge of the suppliers.
5.26 Starting materials should only be purchased from approved suppliers named in the
relevant specification and, where possible, directly from the producer. It is recommended
that the specifications established by the manufacturer for the starting materials be
discussed with the suppliers. It is of benefit that all aspects of the production and control of
the starting material in question, including handling, labelling and packaging
requirements, as well as complaints and rejection procedures are discussed with the
manufacturer and the supplier.
5.27 For each delivery, the containers should be checked for integrity of package and seal and
for correspondence between the delivery note and the supplier�s labels.
5.28 If one material delivery is made up of different batches, each batch must be considered as
separate for sampling, testing and release.
5.29 Starting materials in the storage area should be appropriately labelled (see Chapter 5,
item 13). Labels should bear at least the following information:
� the designated name of the product and the internal code reference where applicable;
� a batch number given at receipt;
� where appropriate, the status of the contents (e.g. in quarantine, on test, released,
rejected);
� where appropriate, an expiry date or a date beyond which retesting is necessary.
When fully computerised storage systems are used, all the above information need not
necessarily be in a legible form on the label.
5.30 There should be appropriate procedures or measures to assure the identity of the contents
of each container of starting material. Bulk containers from which samples have been
drawn should be identified (see Chapter 6, item 13).
5.31 Only starting materials which have been released by the Quality Control Department and
which are within their shelf life should be used.
5.32 Starting materials should only be dispensed by designated persons, following a written
procedure, to ensure that the correct materials are accurately weighed or measured into
clean and properly labelled containers.
5.33 Each dispensed material and its weight or volume should be independently checked and the
check recorded.
5.34 Materials dispensed for each batch should be kept together and conspicuously labelled as
such.
