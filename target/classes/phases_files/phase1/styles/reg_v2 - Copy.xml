 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.9</reg_id>
<reg_text>Operations on different products should not be carried out simultaneously or consecutively
in the same room unless there is no risk of mix-up or cross-contamination.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.10</reg_id>
<reg_text>At every stage of processing, products and materials should be protected from microbial and
other contamination.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.11</reg_id>
<reg_text>When working with dry materials and products, special precautions should be taken to

 <title>Prevention of cross-contamination in production</title> 
 <topic_text>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.18</reg_id>
<reg_text>Contamination of a starting material or of a product by another material or product must
be avoided. This risk of accidental cross-contamination arises from the uncontrolled release
of dust, gases, vapours, sprays or organisms from materials and products in process, from
residues on equipment, and from operators’ clothing. The significance of this risk varies
with the type of contaminant and of product being contaminated. Amongst the most
hazardous contaminants are highly sensitising materials, biological preparations
containing living organisms, certain hormones, cytotoxics, and other highly active
materials. Products in which contamination is likely to be most significant are those
administered by injection, those given in large doses and/or over a long time.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.19</reg_id>
<reg_text>Cross-contamination should be avoided by appropriate technical or organisational
measures, for example:
 a) production in segregated areas (required for products such as penicillins, live
vaccines, live bacterial preparations and some other biologicals), or by campaign
(separation in time) followed by appropriate cleaning;
 b) providing appropriate air-locks and air extraction;
 c) minimising the risk of contamination caused by recirculation or re-entry of untreated
or insufficiently treated air;
 d) keeping protective clothing inside areas where products with special risk of cross-
contamination are processed;
 e) using cleaning and decontamination procedures of known effectiveness, as ineffective
cleaning of equipment is a common source of cross-contamination;
 f) using “closed systems” of production;
 g) testing for residues and use of cleaning status labels on equipment.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.20</reg_id>
<reg_text>Measures to prevent cross-contamination and their effectiveness should be checked
periodically according to set procedures.</reg_text>

 <title>Validation</title> 
 <topic_text>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.21</reg_id>
<reg_text>Validation studies should reinforce Good Manufacturing Practice and be conducted in
accordance with defined procedures. Results and conclusions should be recorded.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.22</reg_id>
<reg_text>When any new manufacturing formula or method of preparation is adopted, steps should be
taken to demonstrate its suitability for routine processing. The defined process, using the
materials and equipment specified, should be shown to yield a product consistently of the
required quality.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.23</reg_id>
<reg_text>Significant amendments to the manufacturing process, including any change in equipment
or materials, which may affect product quality and/or the reproducibility of the process
should be validated.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.24</reg_id>
<reg_text>Processes and procedures should undergo periodic critical  re-validation to ensure that they
remain capable of achieving the intended results.</reg_text>

 <title>Starting materials</title> 
 <topic_text>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.25</reg_id>
<reg_text>The purchase of starting materials is an important operation which should involve staff
who have a particular and thorough knowledge of the suppliers.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.26</reg_id>
<reg_text>Starting materials should only be purchased from approved suppliers named in the
relevant specification and, where possible, directly from the producer. It is recommended
that the specifications established by the manufacturer for the starting materials be
discussed with the suppliers. It is of benefit that all aspects of the production and control of
the starting material in question, including handling, labelling and packaging
requirements, as well as complaints and rejection procedures are discussed with the
manufacturer and the supplier.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.27</reg_id>
<reg_text> For each delivery, the containers should be checked for integrity of package and seal and
for correspondence between the delivery note and the supplier’s labels.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.28</reg_id>
<reg_text> If one material delivery is made up of different batches, each batch must be considered as
separate for sampling, testing and release.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.29</reg_id>
<reg_text>Starting materials in the storage area should be appropriately labelled (see Chapter 5,
item 13). Labels should bear at least the following information:
 — the designated name of the product and the internal code reference where applicable;
 — a batch number given at receipt;
 — where appropriate, the status of the contents (e.g. in quarantine, on test, released,
rejected);
 — where appropriate, an expiry date or a date beyond which retesting is necessary.
When fully computerised storage systems are used, all the above information need not
necessarily be in a legible form on the label.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.30</reg_id>
<reg_text>There should be appropriate procedures or measures to assure the identity of the contents
of each container of starting material. Bulk containers from which samples have been
drawn should be identified (see Chapter 6, item 13).</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.31</reg_id>
<reg_text> Only starting materials which have been released by the Quality Control Department and
which are within their shelf life should be used.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.32</reg_id>
<reg_text>Starting materials should only be dispensed by designated persons, following a written
procedure, to ensure that the correct materials are accurately weighed or measured into
clean and properly labelled containers.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.33</reg_id>
<reg_text> Each dispensed material and its weight or volume should be independently checked and the
check recorded.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.34</reg_id>
<reg_text>Materials dispensed for each batch should be kept together and conspicuously labelled as
such.</reg_text>

Packaging materials</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.40</reg_id>
<reg_text>The purchase, handling and control of primary and printed packaging materials shall be
accorded attention similar to that given to starting materials.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.41</reg_id>
<reg_text>Particular attention should be paid to printed materials. They should be stored in
adequately secure conditions such as to exclude unauthorised access. Cut labels and other
loose printed materials should be stored and transported in separate closed containers so as
to avoid mix-ups. Packaging materials should be issued for use only by authorised
personnel following an approved and documented procedure</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.42</reg_id>
<reg_text> Each delivery or batch of printed or primary packaging material should be given a specific
reference number or identification mark.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.43</reg_id>
<reg_text>Outdated or obsolete primary packaging material or printed packaging material should be
destroyed and this disposal recorded.</reg_text>

 <title>Packaging operations</title> 
 <topic_text>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.44</reg_id>
<reg_text>When setting up a programme for the packaging operations, particular attention should be
given to minimising the risk of cross-contamination, mix-ups or substitutions. Different
products should not be packaged in close proximity unless there is physical segregation.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.45</reg_id>
<reg_text>Before packaging operations are begun, steps should be taken to ensure that the work area,
packaging lines, printing machines and other equipment are clean and free from any
products, materials or documents previously used, if these are not required for the current
operation. The line-clearance should be performed according to an appropriate check-list.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.46</reg_id>
<reg_text>The name and batch number of the product being handled should be displayed at each
packaging station or line.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.47</reg_id>
<reg_text>All products and packaging materials to be used should be checked on delivery to the
packaging department for quantity, identity and conformity with the Packaging
Instructions.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.48</reg_id>
<reg_text>Containers for filling should be clean before filling. Attention should be given to avoiding
and removing any contaminants such as glass fragments and metal particles.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.49</reg_id>
<reg_text>Normally, filling and sealing should be followed as quickly as possible by labelling. If it is
not the case, appropriate procedures should be applied to ensure that no mix-ups or
mislabelling can occur.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.50</reg_id>
<reg_text>The correct performance of any printing operation (for example code numbers, expiry dates)
to be done separately or in the course of the packaging should be checked and recorded.
Attention should be paid to printing by hand which should be re-checked at regular
intervals.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.51</reg_id>
<reg_text>Special care should be taken when using cut-labels and when over-printing is carried out
off-line. Roll-feed labels are normally preferable to cut-labels, in helping to avoid mix-ups.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.52</reg_id>
<reg_text>Checks should be made to ensure that any electronic code readers, label counters or similar
devices are operating correctly.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.53</reg_id>
<reg_text>Printed and embossed information on packaging materials should be distinct and resistant
to fading or erasing.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.54</reg_id>
<reg_text>On-line control of the product during packaging should include at least checking the
following:
 a) general appearance of the packages;
 b) whether the packages are complete;
 c) whether the correct products and packaging materials are used;
 d) whether any over-printing is correct;
 e) correct functioning of line monitors.
Samples taken away from the packaging line should not be return</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.55</reg_id>
<reg_text>Products which have been involved in an unusual event should only be reintroduced into
the process after special inspection, investigation and approval by authorised personnel.
Detailed record should be kept of this operation.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.56</reg_id>
<reg_text>Any significant or unusual discrepancy observed during reconciliation of the amount of bulk
product and printed packaging materials and the number of units produced should be
investigated and satisfactorily accounted for before release</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.57</reg_id>
<reg_text>Upon completion of a packaging operation, any unused batch-coded packaging materials
should be destroyed and the destruction recorded. A documented procedure should be
followed if uncoded printed materials are returned to stock.</reg_text>

<topic> 
 <title>Rejected, recovered and returned materials</title> 
 <topic_text>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.61</reg_id>
<reg_text>Rejected materials and products should be clearly marked as such and stored separately in
restricted areas. They should either be returned to the suppliers or, where appropriate,
reprocessed or destroyed. Whatever action is taken should be approved and recorded by
authorised personnel.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.62</reg_id>
<reg_text>The reprocessing of rejected products should be exceptional. It is only permitted if the
quality of the final product is not affected, if the specifications are met and if it is done in
accordance with a defined and authorised procedure after evaluation of the risks involved.
Record should be kept of the reprocessing.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.63</reg_id>
<reg_text>The recovery of all or part of earlier batches which conform to the required quality by
incorporation into a batch of the same product at a defined stage of manufacture should be
authorised beforehand. This recovery should be carried out in accordance with a defined
procedure after evaluation of the risks involved, including any possible effect on shelf life.
The recovery should be recorded.</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.64</reg_id>
<reg_text>The need for additional testing of any finished product which has been reprocessed, or into
which a recovered product has been incorporated, should be considered by the Quality
Control Department</reg_text> 
 </regulation>
<regulation> 
 <reg_id>5.65</reg_id>
<reg_text>Products returned from the market and which have left the control of the manufacturer
should be destroyed unless without doubt their quality is satisfactory; they may be
considered for re-sale, re-labelling or recovery in a subsequent batch only after they have
been critically assessed by the Quality Control Department in accordance with a written
procedure. The nature of the product, any special storage conditions it requires, its
condition and history, and the time elapsed since it was issued should all be taken into
account in this assessment. Where any doubt arises over the quality of the product, it
should not be considered suitable for re-issue or re-use, although basic chemical re-
processing to recover active ingredient may be possible. Any action taken should be
appropriately recorded.</reg_text>
