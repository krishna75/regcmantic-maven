    <sentence count="18"> Certain APIs of low  molecular weight, such as antibiotics, amino acids, vitamins, and carbohydrates, can  also be produced by recombinant DNA technology.The level of control for these  types of APIs is similar to that employed for classical fermentation. </sentence>
    <sentence count="19"> The term “classical fermentation” refers to processes that use microorganisms  existing in nature and/or modified by conventional methods (e.g. irradiation or  chemical mutagenesis) to produce APIs. </sentence>
    <sentence count="20"> APIs produced by “classical fermentation”  are normally low molecular weight products such as antibiotics, amino acids,  vitamins, and carbohydrates. </sentence>
    <sentence count="21"> Production of APIs or intermediates from cell culture or fermentation involves  biological processes such as cultivation of cells or extraction and purification of  material from living organisms. </sentence>

    <sentence count="23"> The raw  materials used (media, buffer components) may provide the potential for growth of  microbiological contaminants. </sentence>
    <sentence count="24"> Depending on the source, method of preparation, and the intended use of the API or  intermediate, control of bioburden, viral contamination, and/or endotoxins during  manufacturing and monitoring of the process at appropriate stages may be necessary. </sentence>
    <sentence count="25"> Appropriate controls should be established at all stages of manufacturing to  assure intermediate and/or API quality. </sentence>
    <sentence count="26"> While this Guide starts at the cell  culture/fermentation step, prior steps (e.g. cell banking) should be performed under  appropriate process controls. </sentence>
    <sentence count="27"> This Guide covers cell culture/fermentation from the  point at which a vial of the cell bank is retrieved for use in manufacturing. </sentence>
    <sentence count="28"> Appropriate equipment and environmental controls should be used to  minimize the risk of contamination. </sentence>
    <sentence count="29"> The acceptance criteria for quality of the   46 environment and the frequency of monitoring should depend on the step in production  and the production conditions (open, closed, or contained systems). </sentence>
    <sentence count="30"> In general, process controls should take into account: </sentence>
    <sentence count="31"> Maintenance of the Working Cell Bank (where appropriate);  - Proper inoculation and expansion of the culture;  - Control of the critical operating parameters during fermentation/cell culture;  - Monitoring of the process for cell growth, viability (for most cell culture  processes) and productivity where appropriate;  - Harvest and purification procedures that remove cells, cellular debris and  media components while protecting the intermediate or API from  contamination (particularly of a microbiological nature) and from loss of  quality;  - Monitoring of bioburden and, where needed, endotoxin levels at appropriate  stages of production; and  - Viral safety concerns as described in ICH Guideline Q5A Quality of  Biotechnological Products: Viral Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology  Products Derived from Cell Lines of Human or Animal Origin. </sentence>
    <sentence count="32"> Where appropriate, the removal of media components, host cell proteins, other  process-related impurities, product-related impurities and contaminants should be  demonstrated. </sentence>
    <sentence count="33"> Access to cell banks should be limited to authorized personnel. </sentence>
