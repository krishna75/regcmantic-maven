A senior police officer has said there will be "significant arrests" of those involved in rioting in Belfast.

Up to six shots were fired at police during a third night of violence in north Belfast on Tuesday.

Petrol bombs and a pipe bomb were also thrown by nationalist rioters in the Ardoyne area. About 100 officers used water cannon and baton rounds.

Assistant Chief Constable Duncan McCausland said children as young as 10 were involved in the violence.

He said as well as throwing stones and petrol bombs, young children were being used as shields by "sinister elements" organising the riots behind them.

ACC McCausland said police had hours of video footage from before the violence started and would use it to identify the rioters.

"There will be significant arrests in the forthcoming days - individuals will not go scot free," he said.

The rioter who dropped a concrete block on a policewoman on Monday night - seriously injuring her - had already been identified he added.

"Wherever he is in Northern Ireland he can sit and be worried - we will be coming for him," he said.

On Tuesday night, burning barricades were put in place and laser pens were shone at police. Some officers suffered minor injuries.

Politicians have condemned the violence, which has flared at the height of the loyalist marching season.

Sinn Fein have said dissident republicans and "anti-social elements" are behind the violence.
